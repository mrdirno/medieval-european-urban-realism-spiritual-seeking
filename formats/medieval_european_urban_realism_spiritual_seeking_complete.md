## **Chapter 1**

Rainwater pooled in the cobbles, thick with the smell of offal and wet stone. Brother Anselm’s knees ached through his habit, a familiar penance as he knelt not in prayer, but to gather a discarded wooden button. His city offered its sermons in the gutter.



He was late. The light was failing, bleeding from a pewter sky into the damp gloom of the narrow street, and the cart he pushed—a two-wheeled, groaning thing of warped oak—had lodged a wheel in a rut deep enough to drown a cat. He cursed, not with the inventive flair of the river-men, but with a tight, frustrated breath that fogged before his face. He set his shoulder against the cart’s side and heaved. The wood screamed against stone, and the cart lurched free, the contents—a dozen small, crudely carved wooden boxes—shifting with a hollow clatter.

“Careful, dreamer,” a voice rasped from a doorway. Old Liese, the herb-seller, was wrapping her stall’s shutters with gnarled hands. “Break your father’s wares and he’ll carve the price from your hide.”

Tilman didn’t answer, just nodded, his cheeks burning. *Dreamer*. It was her name for him, and it was not a kindness. It meant *head in the clouds*, *useless*, a boy who looked at the cathedral’s half-finished spires instead of the grain of the wood beneath his plane.

He pushed on, the cart’s iron-rimmed wheels a constant, grinding complaint. The sounds of the city closed around him: the clang of a smithy shutting its doors, the distant shout of a bargemaster on the Rhine, the squelch of his own boots. He could smell wet dog, roasting turnips, the profound, fungal stink of the tanner’s quarter carried on the damp air. This was his world. Solid. Smelling of mud and smoke and dung. A world of measured things: board feet, penny weights, the specific heft of a mallet.

His father’s workshop was in the shadow of St. Martin’s, a low, timber-framed building that leaned, as if tired, against the stone bulk of the church. Light spilled from the open shutters of the ground floor, a warm, buttery rectangle in the grey twilight. Tilman guided the cart into the alley beside it, under the dripping eaves, and began unloading the boxes. They were simple things, meant for spices or trinkets, their lids carved with a generic, looping vine. His father’s design. Competent. Uninspired.

The door to the shop flew open before he could reach it.

“The light’s gone,” his father said, not as a greeting, but as an indictment. He stood silhouetted in the doorway, a block of a man with forearms thick from a lifetime of forcing wood into submission. Sawdust clung to his apron like a second skin. “You took the long way by the river again.”

“The bridge was crowded,” Tilman said, hefting the boxes. It was half-true. The bridge *had* been crowded. He had also stopped, for three breaths too long, to watch the water swirl around the piers, imagining the secret currents beneath.

“Hmph.” His father, Albrecht, stepped back to let him in. The workshop was a cave of fragrant shadows: the sweet, resinous scent of pine, the deeper, richer smell of oak, the tang of linseed oil. Finished stools, tables, and chests stood ranked like silent soldiers. On the workbench, under the best light from the window, lay a half-carved panel for a burgher’s house—a scene of the harvest, peasants bent over sheaves. The figures were stout, predictable, their faces smoothed into generic contentment.

“Put them on the shelf. Then you can sweep,” Albrecht said, turning back to his bench. “We have the altar rail for St. Andreas to start tomorrow. Poplar. Straight grain. No time for fancywork.”

Tilman stored the boxes. His eyes drifted to the corner of the workshop, to a cloth-wrapped bundle on a high shelf. His own work. A single panel, no bigger than his handspan, carved from a scrap of pearwood. He hadn’t shown his father. On it, he had tried to capture not a generic saint, but the face of old Widow Greta from the fish market, the map of wrinkles around her eyes, the specific, weary sag of her cheek. It was clumsy. The chisel had slipped, marring the chin. But for a moment, he had felt it—the life in the wood, waiting to be found, not imposed.

“Sweeping, Tilman,” Albrecht said, without looking up. The rasp of his plane was a steady, grinding rhythm.

Tilman took the broom of twigs and began to sweep the day’s detritus—curls of wood like pale shavings of moonlight, gritty dust, a single, bent nail—toward the door. His body performed the task while his mind wandered, as it always did. It wandered to the cathedral, that monstrous, beautiful skeleton of stone clawing its way toward heaven. He thought of the men who worked there, the sculptors and masons. They spoke a different language, one of light and shadow, of saints and demons writhing from stone. Their world was not one of measured feet, but of sublime proportion, of terror and grace made visible.

He was emptying the dustpan into the alley’s muck when he saw the man.

He was a figure of the rain, emerging from the gloom as if woven from it. He was tall, thin to the point of emaciation, wrapped in a cloak of a strange, dull grey that seemed to drink the remaining light. He moved not with the weary trudge of a weary merchant or the hurried scuttle of a servant, but with a slow, deliberate glide, his feet soundless on the wet stones. He carried no pack, no staff. His face was hidden deep within his hood.

The man stopped not ten paces from Tilman, directly under a thin stream of water cascading from a broken gutter. He stood perfectly still. He was looking, Tilman realized, at the carved sign above the workshop door: a relief of a smoothing plane and a chisel crossed.

Then the hood turned. Tilman felt the weight of a gaze from within that darkness. It was not like Old Liese’s sharp glance or his father’s assessing stare. This was a pressure, cool and specific, like the touch of a needle.

“Is this the workshop of Albrecht the joiner?” The voice was dry, papery, without accent or inflection. It seemed to bypass Tilman’s ears and settle directly in his mind.

Tilman found his own voice. “It is.”

“I have a commission.” The man’s hands emerged from his cloak. They were long, pale, the fingers strangely articulate. They held no coin purse. Instead, the right hand made a slow, complex gesture in the air—a shape that was not a sign of the cross, but something older, more angular. Tilman’s eyes tracked it, bewildered.

“My father is inside,” Tilman said, taking a step back toward the door. “You can speak to him.”

“It is not for him.” The hood tilted. “It is for the hands that see the face in the grain. The ears that hear the whisper in the knot.”

A cold that had nothing to do with the rain shot down Tilman’s spine. He glanced involuntarily toward the workshop, toward the cloth-wrapped panel on the high shelf. No one knew of that. No one.

“I don’t understand,” Tilman whispered.

“A box,” the man said, his voice dropping until it was almost lost in the patter of rain on the eaves. “Not for spice. Not for trinket. A box to hold a question. Oak, aged, without flaw. Joined not with glue, but with silence. Carved not with pattern, but with absence. A box that is a door.”

Tilman shook his head. “My father… he makes solid things. Useful things.”

“Usefulness is a cage,” the man hissed, and for the first time, there was a flicker of emotion in that papery voice—impatience, or perhaps hunger. “This is a key. Can you forge it?”

From within the workshop, Albrecht’s voice boomed. “Tilman! The door’s open! Are you heating the whole street?”

The grey man’s hands vanished back into his cloak. He took one step backward, merging with the deepening shadow of the alley wall. “Three nights hence,” he breathed. “At the midnight bell. Bring it to the yard of the White Sisters, by the old well. Come alone. If the work is true, you will be shown the currency of shadows.”

“What question?” Tilman blurted, his heart hammering against his ribs. “What door?”

But the figure was dissolving into the rain and gloom, becoming one with the mist. Only his final words hung in the sodden air, a whisper that seemed to come from the stones themselves: “Your own.”

“Tilman!” His father was at the door now, a solid, angry shape blocking the light. “Who were you talking to? Get in here. You’re dithering like a simpleton.”

Tilman turned, his limbs stiff. “A… a man. Asking directions.”

Albrecht peered past him into the empty, dripping alley. “In this weather? More likely a thief casing the shop. Bolt the door. And bank the fire. We’ve wasted enough day.”

That night, in the loft above the workshop where he slept, Tilman lay awake. The rain had softened to a whisper on the thatch. The familiar smells of wood and glue were a comfort he could not feel. He stared into the darkness, seeing not the rafters, but those long, pale fingers tracing a shape in the air. *A box to hold a question. Joined with silence. Carved with absence.*

It was madness. A trick. A test by some malicious spirit or a wandering madman.

Yet.

He thought of the pearwood panel, of the desperate, fumbling need to make Widow Greta’s tired kindness live in the wood. He thought of the cathedral stonemasons, singing their plainchants as they gave form to angels a hundred feet in the air. They worked in service of God, of a known truth. This… this was a service to a whisper. A commission from a shadow.

*The hands that see the face in the grain.*

His own hands, calloused from his father’s tools, clenched in the rough wool of his blanket. They were joiner’s hands, meant for measured cuts and firm joints. They did not see faces. They did not listen for whispers.

But what if they could?

A dangerous, liquid warmth spread through his chest, a feeling utterly alien to the dutiful chill of his daily life. It was the thrill of a secret. Of a path glimpsed in a dark wood.

Three nights hence. The yard of the White Sisters. A place of quiet piety and washed linen, now a rendezvous for… what?

He knew, with a certainty that felt like the first true cut of a chisel into untouched wood, that he would make the box. He would find a piece of oak, flawless. He would join it, not as his father taught him, but with a perfect, seamless fit, a joint so tight it would hold without glue. He would carve it not with vines or crosses, but would leave its surface bare, polished only by the oil of his own hands, a vessel of pure potential.

He would make a door.

And three nights hence, he would walk into the rain and the dark to see what lay on the other side.

# Chapter 2

## **Chapter 2**

The oak was a problem. Flawless oak, aged and dry, was currency. It was stacked in the lean-to behind the workshop, each plank accounted for in his father’s ledger, each destined for a specific, paid-for purpose: a merchant’s counter, a bailiff’s strongbox, the altar rail for St. Andreas. To take even a offcut was theft, not of wood, but of trust, of the unspoken law that governed their precarious existence.

For two days, Tilman moved through his work like a ghost in his own life. He rough-shaped the poplar for the altar rail, the blows of his mallet on the chisel ringing with a hollow, guilty echo. He mixed glue, its stink of boiled hooves thick in his throat. He listened to his father’s instructions, his critiques, his grumbled philosophy of wood—“It has no secrets, boy. It only has grain. Follow it, or fight it and lose.”—and heard only a distant, meaningless drone.

His mind was in the alley, in the rain, with the grey man’s whisper. *The currency of shadows.* What did that mean? Payment in phantom coin? A favour from the dark? Or something else, something that made the skin on his arms prickle—knowledge?

On the afternoon of the second day, delivering a repaired stool to a vintner near the river gate, he found his opportunity. The vintner’s warehouse was a cavernous space smelling of sour wine and damp earth. In a corner, half-buried under a torn sailcloth, was a pile of discarded crate wood. Among the splintered pine, he saw it: a short, thick plank of oak, dark with age, one edge blackened by fire. It was a reject, worthless for a barrel or a ship. But the heart of it, where the fire had not reached… Tilman ran a thumb over the surface. It was tight-grained, hard as iron, singing a silent, deep note to his touch.

“That muck?” the vintner’s steward said, seeing him look. “From a fire two summers back. Take it if you want. Saves us burning it.”

Tilman’s mouth was dry. “For kindling?”

“Aye. Or to ward off evil spirits,” the man laughed, making a crude sign against the evil eye. “Burnt wood’s good for that, they say.”

Tilman took it. He carried the stool in one hand and the charred, heavy plank under his other arm, feeling its weight as both a prize and a condemnation. It was not theft. It was salvage. But the lie he would have to tell—that he’d found it by the river, that he wanted to practice his joints on scrap—coated his tongue with a bitter film.

Back in the workshop, he hid the plank under a pile of hay in the donkey’s stall at the back of the yard. The animal blinked its long-lashed eyes at him, chewing slowly, a silent accomplice.

The night of the commission, his father retired early, his breathing soon a steady saw-song through the floorboards. Tilman waited, his body taut as a bowstring, listening to the city’s sounds die away: the last call of the watch, the bark of a dog, the sigh of the wind shifting the weathervane on St. Martin’s spire.

At the first, faint tremor of the great bell of the cathedral announcing Matins—the midnight office—he moved.

He worked not in the shop, but in the yard, by the faint, greasy light of a single tallow dip shielded from the wind by an overturned bucket. The cold bit his fingers. The burnt plank lay before him on the chopping block. He took his father’s finest saw, its teeth gleaming in the weak light, and began.

He did not sketch a design. The grey man’s words were his only plan. *A box to hold a question.* It must be simple. A cube. Perfectly proportioned. He sawed the good wood free of its charred shell, revealing flesh the colour of honeyed ale. The scent released was profound, oaky and sweet, a smell of deep forests and time.

He cut the pieces for the sides, the top, the bottom. His hands, usually so obedient to taught technique, moved with a new, intuitive certainty. He cut the joining edges not with standard rabbets, but with tiny, interlocking tongues and grooves, a puzzle-box joint he had only imagined. He pared them with a chisel, shaving whisker-thin curls until the edges met with a soft, sighing *click*. No glue. Just silence.

The carving of absence. He understood now. He took a piece of pumice stone and began to smooth the outer surfaces. Not to ornament, but to remove. To erase the marks of the saw, the plane, his own uncertainty. He worked until the wood was not polished to a shine, but to a soft, matte luster, like skin. It drank the dim light. It felt alive, warm under his cold hands.

As he fitted the last piece, the lid, he paused. A question. What was his question? It was a formless, aching thing in his chest. *Why does the world feel like a set of walls? What is the shape of the longing I feel when I look at the cathedral spires? Who am I, beyond a pair of hands that follow grain?* He could not carve that. He could only pour the ache of it into the making.

He placed his palms on the completed box. It was a little larger than his two fists together. It was profoundly simple. And it was, in its seamless, silent unity, the most beautiful thing he had ever made. It felt less like an object and more like a captured moment of intent.

The bell of St. Martin’s rang for the next office, a lonely sound in the sleeping city. Time.

He wrapped the box in a scrap of undyed linen, slipped it into the leather bag he used for his tools, and pulled his cloak around his shoulders. He unbolted the yard gate, its iron screech like a shout in the silent night.

Cologne at midnight was a different city. The proud merchant houses were shuttered monoliths. The streets, so choked with life by day, were empty canals of shadow. The only light came from the occasional vigil lamp before a saint’s niche in a wall, painting tiny, trembling pools of gold on the wet stone. He moved like a thief, keeping to the darkest alleys, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. The bag over his shoulder felt impossibly heavy, humming with a strange energy.

The convent of the White Sisters was near the northern wall, a quiet enclave of piety. Its high walls were whitewashed, glowing faintly in the gloom. The public yard, with its ancient, capped well, was accessible by a low archway.

Tilman paused in the darkness of the arch, peering into the yard. It was a square of beaten earth, empty save for the well-head—a stone cylinder crowned with a rusty iron winch. Moonlight, breaking through a rent in the clouds, silvered the puddles. It was utterly still.

Had it been a cruel joke? A test he had failed by simply showing up? The shame, hot and sudden, began to rise in him.

Then a shape detached itself from the deeper shadow at the base of the convent wall. The grey man. He seemed to coalesce from the darkness itself. He stood by the well, waiting.

Tilman’s legs felt wooden. He forced himself forward, his boots crunching on the grit. He stopped a few paces from the man. The air here was cold, still, smelling of wet mortar and old herbs.

“You came.” The papery voice was the same.

“I made the box.” Tilman’s voice sounded young, brittle, to his own ears.

“Show me.”

Tilman fumbled with the bag, drew out the linen-wrapped bundle. His fingers trembled as he unfolded the cloth, revealing the oak box. In the moonlight, it looked like a block of solidified darkness, its soft luster absorbing the silver light.

The grey man did not reach for it. He leaned forward slightly, his hooded gaze upon it. He did not speak for a long time. The only sound was the distant gurgle of water in a drain.

“Yes,” he breathed finally. The word held a satisfaction that was almost physical. “The joint is silence. The surface is a listening. You have the touch.” The hood lifted toward Tilman. “And your question?”

“It… it is inside,” Tilman stammered. “I put it there in the making.”

A low sound came from the hood. It might have been a laugh, or a sigh. “Good. A question spoken is a bird released. A question held… is a key turned.”

The man’s pale hand emerged. This time, he held something small between thumb and forefinger. It caught no light. It was a fragment, irregular, dark as a hole in the world. It looked like stone, or maybe ancient, petrified wood.

“The currency,” the man said. He placed the fragment on the flat lid of Tilman’s box. “A piece of the first threshold. Not for you to spend. For you to know. To recognize.”

Tilman stared at the black fragment. It inspired no desire, only a deep, unsettling reverence, like looking upon a saint’s bone. “Recognize what?”

“The other doors,” the man said. He gestured vaguely toward the sleeping city, toward the world. “They are everywhere. In stone. In sound. In the space between heartbeats. Most are blind, shut. Some are watched. A few… a few are open. This,” he tapped the fragment lightly, “will warm near them. It will whisper. It is a compass for a journey you have already begun.”

Tilman’s mind reeled. This was not payment. It was a contagion. A responsibility. “I am a joiner’s son. I make boxes and stools.”

“You are a maker of doors,” the grey man corrected, his voice sharpening. “Now you must learn to see them. Start with the city. See it not as a map of trades, but as a lattice of… intentions. Of old prayers soaked into stone, of fears buried under thresholds, of longings hung in bell-towers. Your box is your first true work. It is a proof. It will attract attention. Not all of it will be as… courteous as mine.”

A new, different fear, cold and sharp, pierced Tilman’s chest. “What attention?”

But the man was fading again, stepping back into the wall’s shadow. “The attention of those who guard the thresholds. And those who wish to break them. Keep the fragment hidden. Show the box to no one. And when the compass stirs… follow.”

“Wait! Who are you?”

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere, already mingling with the night wind. “A fellow traveler. A whisper in the masonry. We will speak again when you have seen your first true door.”

And he was gone.

Tilman stood alone in the moonlit yard, the cold seeping into his bones. On the lid of his beautiful, silent box, the black fragment lay like a drop of frozen night. He picked it up. It was shockingly cold, and heavier than it looked. It felt less like an object and more like a weight tied to his soul.

He had asked for no prophecy, no grand destiny. He had only wanted his hands to make something true. And now he held a piece of a first threshold, and the world had rearranged itself around him into a map of hidden doors and unseen watchers.

He wrapped the fragment in the linen, tucked it and the box back into his bag. As he turned to leave the yard, his eyes fell on the well—a simple stone cylinder, a functional thing. But for a fleeting instant, he didn’t see a well. He saw a vertical mouth, a throat leading down into the absolute dark beneath the city, a door sealed only by a slab of stone and a rusted winch.

He fled the yard, the image seared into his mind. The city around him no longer felt like home. It felt like a mask. And behind it, everything was watching.

# Chapter 3

## **Chapter 3**

The poplar altar rail was a cage. Tilman’s hands moved over the pale, bland wood, executing his father’s precise, soulless design—a repeating pattern of stylized vines and pomegranates, a symbol of the Church’s abundance he carved with the joy of a prisoner turning a mill-wheel. The chisel felt foreign in his grip, a clumsy stick compared to the intuitive tool it had become in the midnight yard.

The hidden box and its dark fragment were buried under the loose floorboard beneath his straw pallet. They were a secret sun around which his thoughts now orbited, draining light and meaning from everything else. His father’s voice, the shop’s smells, the predictable grain of the poplar—all were flat, dull echoes of a world he realized he had only ever seen the surface of.

*See the city as a lattice of intentions.*

The instruction haunted him. As he ran errands—delivering a finished chest to the wool-merchant, buying nails from the ironsmith—he found his eyes sliding past the faces, the goods, the noise. He looked at the angles where walls met, at the carvings over doorways worn smooth by time, at the patterns of wear on the cathedral steps. He listened to the sounds of the city not as a cacophony, but as a layered composition: the bass grind of cartwheels, the tenor of hawkers’ cries, the faint, high descant of the monastic bells from a dozen churches. Was there an intention in the way the sound pooled in the market square? In the way the shadow of the cathedral’s crane fell across the butcher’s row at precisely noon?

It was on the third day after the meeting, sent to collect a debt from a dyer whose shop clung to the banks of the foul-smelling *Bach* stream, that the fragment stirred.

The dyer’s lane was a canyon of leaning, half-timbered houses, their upper stories so close they nearly kissed overhead, shutting out the sky. The air was thick with the pungent, metallic reek of urine and madder root. Tilman had been here before; it was a place of vivid, staining colours and perpetual damp. But this time, as he passed under a low, blackened archway leading into a tiny courtyard shared by three houses, a warmth bloomed against his chest.

He froze. He had sewn the black fragment into a small leather pouch and hung it on a thong around his neck, hidden under his tunic. It had been a cold, inert weight. Now, it was warm. Not hot, but alive, like the skin of a creature that had been sleeping.

His heart stuttered. He looked around the courtyard. It was a dismal place. A single, stunted elder tree grew from a crack in the stones. Lines were strung between the houses, hung with drab, dripping cloth. A stone trough, green with slime, overflowed with rusty-looking water. In one corner was a doorway, lower than the rest, its oak door ancient, banded with iron, and set with a massive, tarnished lock. It looked disused, sealed for decades.

The warmth from the fragment pulsed gently, in time with his own quickening heartbeat. It seemed to pull him toward that low door.

“Looking for someone, joiner’s boy?”

Tilman jumped. A woman stood in the doorway of the dyer’s shop, her arms stained blue to the elbow. Magda, the dyer’s wife. She was sharp-eyed, missing nothing.

“The money for the stool,” Tilman managed, tearing his gaze from the low door. “My father sent me.”

“Inside. He’s counting coppers.” She jerked her head, but her eyes lingered on him, then flicked to the sealed door. A slight frown creased her stained forehead.

Tilman collected the coins from the dyer, a sullen man who counted each penny twice. The whole time, the fragment hummed against his skin, a silent, persistent beacon. As he left, he couldn’t help it. He paused in the courtyard, pretending to adjust his boot, and stared at the door.

Up close, he saw it was not entirely plain. Around the lock, almost worn away by time and grime, were faint, shallow carvings. Not letters. Symbols. A spiral. A shape like a branching river. A series of interlocking rings. They were not Christian. They felt older, like the bones of the land poking through the city’s skin.

“That’s nothing for you.”

Magda was back, wiping her hands on a rag. Her voice was low, no longer curious, but edged with warning.

“What is it?” Tilman asked, the question out before he could stop it.

“An old cellar. From before the great fire. Walls are unsafe. My man’s grandfather sealed it.” Her words were too quick, too pat. “It’s just a door to nowhere. Now off with you.”

The fragment’s warmth intensified, as if in argument. *A door to nowhere.* But the compass said otherwise. This was one of them. A watched door? A guarded one?

He nodded, muttering thanks, and hurried from the courtyard. But he didn’t go far. He ducked into an alcove across the lane and watched. For a long time, nothing. Then, as the light began to fade, Magda emerged again. She went not to the well or the lines, but straight to the low door. She didn’t try to open it. She took a small clay bowl from her apron, placed it on the stones before the threshold, and from a flask, poured out a measure of dark liquid—wine, or perhaps blood?—into the bowl. She made a swift, complex gesture over it, different from the grey man’s but just as deliberate, and then hurried back inside, not looking back.

A offering. A ward.

Tilman slipped away, his mind afire. The city *was* a lattice. And he had found a node. A door watched by a dyer’s wife with stained hands and old knowledge. What lay behind it? Why guard a cellar?

The excitement was short-lived. When he returned to the workshop, his father was waiting, his face like thunder. On the workbench lay Tilman’s altar rail panel. And beside it, the fine-toothed saw Tilman had used in the yard, its teeth still clogged with minute, honey-coloured oak dust.

“You used my best saw,” Albrecht said, his voice dangerously quiet. “On scrap wood, you said. By the river.” He picked up the saw, pointed to the oak dust, then to the pale, pristine poplar dust around the altar rail. “This didn’t come from poplar. This is oak. Aged oak. And this cut…” He examined the teeth. “This is joinery work. Fine work. Not practice.”

Tilman’s blood turned to ice. He said nothing.

“You’ve been working on something else. On someone else’s commission.” Albrecht’s eyes narrowed, the hurt beneath the anger suddenly visible. “You’re taking private work. Using my tools. My time. Behind my back.”

“It’s not a commission,” Tilman whispered, the truth useless. “It was just… for me.”

“For you?” Albrecht slammed his hand on the bench, making the tools jump. “*For you?* We work to eat, boy! We work to keep this roof! Your ‘for you’ is stolen time! Stolen material!” He leaned in, his breath sour with disappointment. “I have been patient. I know your head is in the clouds. But this is betrayal. Solid as this wood.”

The words were physical blows. Tilman hung his head, the shame complete. The secret sun under his floorboard now felt like a stolen jewel, burning him with its hidden light.

“You will finish this rail,” Albrecht decreed, each word a nail. “And you will do no other work, for yourself or anyone, until it is done and paid for. And the money for the dyer? It goes to replace the oak you stole. Whatever you made ‘for you’ stays hidden, or I will burn it myself. Do you understand?”

Tilman nodded, unable to speak.

“Get out of my sight. Go sweep the yard. Maybe you can clear the nonsense from your head while you’re at it.”

Tilman stumbled into the yard. The grey twilight was the same colour as his despair. The compass fragment was cold again against his chest. He had seen a door, but the cost was the trust of the only world he had ever known. He had gained a secret compass, but lost his true north.

He took the broom, its twigs scraping on the stones like a mocking whisper. He was caught between lattices: the solid, punishing world of his father, of wood and debt and duty, and the whispering, hidden world of doors and fragments and intentions. He belonged to neither now. He was a ghost in both.

As he swept, his eyes drifted to the alley gate, to the city beyond. Somewhere out there was a low door in a dyer’s courtyard, watched by a woman with stained hands. Somewhere was a grey man made of whispers. And here, under his feet, was a box that held a question he could no longer articulate, and a fragment of a first threshold.

The broom in his hands felt like the only real thing. And it was a tool for cleaning up dust, for maintaining order, for keeping the hidden things safely buried.

He swept on, the first major complication settling around his shoulders not like a cloak, but like a yoke.

# Chapter 4

## **Chapter 4**

The dust in the dyer’s courtyard had a different quality to the rain-slick grime of his father’s yard. It was a fine, coloured powder, a spectral sediment of madder red and woad blue that clung to the wet stones and the hem of Tilman’s cloak as he slipped through the gate three days later. The air was thick with the vinegar-sharp tang of fixing agents and the earthy reek of fermented urine from the vats. It was a smell that announced industry, a world away from the clean, punishing scent of planed oak. Tilman felt like a ghost trespassing in a realm of vivid, staining life.

He was here on stolen time, a sliver of an hour bargained for by promising to deliver a repaired stool to a tanner’s widow on the far side of the Neumarkt. The compass fragment was a cold, urgent weight against his breastbone. The low door in the far wall, the one the woman had guarded, was his true destination. It looked even smaller by day, a dark mouth set in crumbling brick, half-hidden behind a stack of empty, stained barrels. His father’s decree was a yoke, but this pull was a lodestone. He had lost one north; he had to find another, or be forever adrift.

He approached the door, his heart a frantic bird in a cage of ribs. He raised a hand to the rough, paint-blistered wood.

“It’s locked. And for good reason.”

The voice came from behind the vats. The woman emerged, wiping her hands on a rag already a kaleidoscope of pigments. Her hands were indeed stained, a permanent map of her trade in the creases of her knuckles and under her nails. Her face was sharp, watchful, not unkind but reserved, as if she were assessing the fastness of a colour.

“I… I need to see,” Tilman said, his voice too loud in the enclosed yard.

“See what?” She tilted her head. “The old store-room? It’s full of broken things and rat-nests. Nothing for a carpenter’s boy.”

He flinched at the label. *Carpenter’s boy*. That was all he was now, all he was permitted to be. The shame of his theft was a public whisper. He straightened. “The man. The grey man. He said… he said the door was a first threshold.”

Her expression did not change, but something in her eyes shifted, a shutter opening a crack. She looked him up and down, taking in the worn boots, the too-short sleeves, the haunted hunger in his face that had nothing to do with bread. “Did he now.” It wasn’t a question. She tossed her rag over a barrel. “And what did you trade him?”

“A… a sun. Carved from oak.”

A faint, almost imperceptible nod. “A sun. For a direction. A fair enough price, for a first time.” She walked to the door, pulled a key from a cord around her neck. It was old, iron, heavy with rust. “My name is Elke. This is my yard. What comes through that door is my business. You understand? You bring trouble here, you answer to my vats. They can hide more than cloth.”

Tilman understood. It was a language he recognized: the economy of risk, the weight of consequence. He nodded.

The key turned with a screech that set his teeth on edge. The door swung inward on groaning hinges, revealing not a store-room, but a narrow, descending staircase carved from the same crumbling brick. The air that wafted up was cold, dry, and carried a scent Tilman had only smelled once before—in the moment the compass fragment had warmed against his skin. It was the smell of distance, of old stone, of intention.

“Down,” Elke said. “I’ll wait here. If you’re not back by the time the shadow reaches that crack, I lock it. You can find your way out from the other side, or you can’t.”

He didn’t ask what other side. He stepped over the threshold.

The stairs were steep, uneven, worn smooth in the centres by passages he could not fathom. The light from the courtyard died after five steps, leaving him in a blackness so complete it felt solid. He fumbled, his hand brushing the cold wall. Panic, greasy and familiar, began to rise in his throat. Then, a faint, bluish light bloomed. It came from the compass fragment. It leaked through his tunic, casting his own bones in shadow, and illuminated the steps just enough to see the next footfall. It was not a light to see by, but a light to *step* by. A light of mere adequacy. He descended.

The staircase ended in a low, arched corridor. The blue-grey light from the fragment showed walls that were not brick, but a seamless, polished stone veined with threads of silver that drank the light. The air was silent, a silence so profound it pressed against his ears. He walked, his boots making no sound on the floor. The corridor seemed to go on forever, a monotony of stone and his own, trembling light.

This was the first challenge: not a monster, not a puzzle, but the sheer, emptying weight of the *between*. The silence began to whisper. Not with voices, but with his own thoughts, amplified and distorted. *Thief. Failure. Carpenter’s boy. Your father’s right. This is nonsense. A ghost in both worlds.* The corridor offered nothing to contradict them. It simply was. Survival here was not about food or swordplay; it was about continuing to put one foot in front of the other when every instinct screamed to turn back, to return to the solid, punishing world of the yard where at least the rules were known. He walked until his legs ached, until time lost meaning. He learned to breathe through the silence, to let the accusations wash over him like the greasy Cologne rain. He learned the first lesson: to be in this place was to endure yourself.

Just as despair threatened to solidify around him, the corridor opened.

He emerged not into a grand hall, but into a space that felt like the underside of a vast, forgotten bridge. It was a cavern, but one shaped by artifice—great, curved ribs of the same silver-veined stone arcing overhead, holding back the weight of earth and time. Below, nestled in the cavern’s floor, was a makeshift settlement. It was a shanty of cobbled-together shelters: patched tents of strange, iridescent cloth, lean-tos built from what looked like ship timbers and cathedral pews, hovels crafted from packed earth and woven roots. A few feeble cook-fires smouldered, their smoke drawn up into vents in the stone ceiling. The air was warmer here, and carried a murmur of voices, the clink of metal, the smell of strange herbs and unwashed bodies.

This was not a realm of spirits or angels. It was a refugee camp.

Tilman stood at the edge, clutching his faint light, feeling more exposed than in the endless corridor. Figures moved in the half-light. A woman with hair the colour of tarnished copper mended a net that glimmered like spider-silk. A broad-shouldered man with one milky eye carefully sharpened a blade of black glass. A pair of children, their skin faintly scaled like a lizard’s, chased a glowing orb that hummed. They all wore the same look—a wary resilience, the expression of creatures living in the lee of a storm.

A man noticed him first. He was seated on a stool by a fire, whittling a piece of pale wood with a curved knife. He was perhaps fifty, with a traveller’s leanness and a beard shot through with grey and a startling, vibrant green. His clothes were a practical patchwork of leather and coarse linen. He looked up, his eyes—a clear, penetrating grey—meeting Tilman’s. He didn’t seem surprised.

“New,” the man stated, his voice a low rasp. “Fresh from the Threshold. You have the look. All wide eyes and lost steps.” He gestured with his knife to a spot by the fire. “Sit. The damp here gets into the bones if you let it.”

This was the second challenge. Not to fight, but to approach. To trust an offered seat in a world where nothing was as it seemed. Tilman hesitated, then moved forward, letting the light from his fragment fade as the firelight took over. He sat on the hard ground.

“I’m Tilman.”

“Korbinian,” the man said, returning to his whittling. The shape was becoming a bird, wings half-folded. “You traded for a fragment, then. What was it?”

“A compass. Or part of one.”

Korbinian’s hands stilled for a moment. “A seeking thing. That tracks.” He glanced at Tilman’s hands, noted the callouses, the fine scars from chisels and splinters. “You’re a maker. Good. We have use for makers here. If you can pay the fare.”

“Fare?”

“For the Gate,” said a new voice. A young woman ducked out of a nearby tent. She was perhaps Tilman’s age, with a fierce, pointed face and hair shorn close to her skull. She wore a coat of tough, grey hide, and moved with a tense, efficient grace. Her eyes, a dark brown, scanned Tilman with none of Korbinian’s measured calm. They were assessing, calculating risk. “Nothing’s free in the Shallows, carpenter. Not food, not shelter, not passage. Especially not passage.”

“This is Lotte,” Korbinian said, a hint of weariness in his voice. “She believes bluntness is a virtue.”

“It is,” Lotte said, squatting by the fire and pulling a whetstone from her belt. She began to sharpen a short, utilitarian spear. “So. Carpenter. What can you do besides push a plane? Can you fix a broken hinge on a door that dreams? Can you reinforce a chest that holds a sigh? Can you tell good intention-wood from rotten?”

Tilman stared at her. The words were nonsense, yet he felt their meaning prick at him. “I… I work with wood. I understand grain. I understand joinery that holds under weight.”

“Weight here isn’t always from above,” Korbinian murmured, his knife whispering against the wood. “Sometimes it’s from within. Or from before.”

Lotte snorted. “Poetry doesn’t patch a roof.” She looked back at Tilman. “We need the lintel over the East Niche reinforced. The last tremor shook something loose in the stones above. It’s weeping slow ideas. Confuses the children. Korbinian says the wood there is ‘reluctant’. Thinks it needs a maker’s hand to soothe it. You do that, you earn your keep for a week. And we talk about your compass.”

It was a test. A simple task, translated into impossible terms. But it was a task. It was wood. Tilman felt a flicker of the old certainty, the feel of grain beneath his fingers. He nodded. “Show me.”

The East Niche was a recess at the far end of the cavern, where one of the great stone ribs met the floor. A rough timber lintel, made of a wood so dark it was almost black, spanned the opening. Above it, a crack in the stone wept a viscous, silver substance that fell with the slow, gravity-defying pace of cold honey. Where it pooled on the lintel, the wood seemed to shimmer, and a low, discordant hum filled the air. The two scaled children sat nearby, staring listlessly at the wall, their game forgotten.

“See?” Lotte said, keeping her distance. “Rotten metaphysics. Fix it.”

Tilman approached. He ran a hand over the lintel. The wood was cold and dense, like ironwood, but it vibrated faintly under his touch. It wasn’t reluctant; it was *strained*. It was holding up more than stone. It was holding up a concept—the integrity of this niche, the definition of this space as separate from the raw earth. The silver seepage was blurring that definition. The wood was fighting a war on two fronts: weight and ambiguity.

He didn’t have his tools. He had his hands, his knowledge, and the faint, seeking warmth of the fragment against his chest. He closed his eyes, letting his fingers read the grain. He found the points of maximum tension, where the wood’s own structure was buckling under the paradoxical load. He pressed his thumbs there, not with force, but with a firm, acknowledging pressure. He thought not of bracing, but of *sharing*. He imagined his own understanding of joinery—the way a mortise accepted a tenon, the way glue sealed a seam—as a kind of strength. He offered that understanding to the wood, a silent communion of maker and material.

He didn’t know how long he stood there. The discordant hum began to soften, to find a resonance. The shimmer on the wood’s surface stilled, the silver droplets beading up and rolling off, falling with a normal *plink* into a clay pot Lotte had swiftly placed below. The vibration under his fingers eased, settling into a steady, supportive firmness.

He opened his eyes. The two children blinked, shook their heads as if clearing water from their ears, and resumed their chase of the humming orb.

Lotte was staring at him, her earlier bluntness replaced by a look of frank appraisal. “Huh.”

Korbinian smiled, a small, satisfied thing. “Told you. A maker.”

Tilman stepped back, his knees weak. The act had drained him, not physically, but in some deeper reserve. He had spoken a language he didn’t know he knew.

“You’ve paid your fare for now,” Lotte said, her voice marginally less sharp. “You can bunk in the lean-to by the midden. It smells, but the roof doesn’t drip paradox.” She turned to go, then paused. “The compass. You’re seeking a door. A specific one.”

“How did you—”

“It’s always a door,” Korbinian said, rising. “Or a window. Or a mirror. Something that frames a *between*. But seeking draws attention. Not all of it friendly.”

“There are factions here,” Lotte said, lowering her voice. “Collectors. They hoard fragments, artefacts. They don’t seek doors; they seek to own the thresholds. They like new seekers. You’re full of potential, and potential is a currency they understand. They’ll offer you help. They’ll give you a map, a tool, a clue. The price is always your fragment, and a piece of your intention. They turn seekers into… employees.”

“And there are the Eaters,” Korbinian added, his face grim. “Though we don’t say that name too loud. They’re not a faction. They’re a pestilence. They don’t care for fragments or doors. They feed on the *connections* between things. On meaning itself. They fray the edges of places like this. They make the corridors longer, the silence heavier. They turn solid intention into dust. If you see a patch of grey that moves against the wind, that smells of salt and static… you run. You don’t look back.”

Tilman felt the cold of the cavern seep into him. His father’s wrath was a simple, comprehensible fire. This was a landscape of subtle, consuming shadows. His enemy was not a person, but a principle: the principle of ownership over seeking, of consumption over connection.

His test came not a day later. Korbinian had set him to repairing a series of small, intricate boxes—memory-caskets, he called them—that had been damaged in the tremor. As Tilman worked, fitting tiny splines of whisper-thin cedar, a man approached.

He was impeccably dressed in a suit of charcoal-grey wool that seemed to drink the firelight, a stark contrast to the patchwork around him. His face was narrow, intelligent, clean-shaven. He carried a cane of polished ebony. He smelled of lavender and camphor.

“Master Tilman,” the man said, his voice a smooth, cultured baritone. “A pleasure. I am Valerius. I understand you have an affinity for wood. A rare gift here in the Shallows.” He gestured with his cane to the boxes. “Fine work. Precise. It speaks of a mind that values order.”

Tilman said nothing, his fingers still moving.

“I represent a consortium,” Valerius continued, unperturbed. “We appreciate talent. We could provide you with proper tools. A proper workspace. Access to rare woods—heartwood from a tree that wept at the Crucifixion, timber from a ship that sailed the Mythic Seas. All to further your… seeking.” His eyes flickered to Tilman’s chest, where the fragment lay hidden. “We have charts. Maps of the deeper Lattices. We could help you find your door far quicker than groping in the dark with these… admirable refugees.”

The offer was a warm, well-lit room after a long crawl in a cold ditch. It was recognition. It was a path. Lotte’s warning echoed in his head. *Potential is a currency.*

“What would it cost?” Tilman asked, his voice rough.

Valerius smiled. It didn’t reach his eyes, which were the colour of flint. “A gesture of mutual commitment. Your fragment, as collateral. A sign of trust. We would, of course, return it when your work is done. And a simple oath, to share what you find beyond your door. Knowledge, after all, should belong to those who can best curate it.”

*Own the thresholds.* Tilman looked at his hands, at the simple, honest work of repair. He thought of Elke’s key, of Korbinian’s whittling, of Lotte’s blunt protection. He thought of the box under his floorboards, and the sun he had carved not for trade, but for the sheer need to make it.

“My fragment isn’t for collateral,” he said quietly, not looking up. “And what I seek is my own.”

The warmth vanished from Valerius’s face. It wasn’t replaced by anger, but by a cold, blank dismissal, as if Tilman had just ceased to be a person and had become an inconvenient object. “A pity. The life of a vagrant in the Shallows is… short. And cold. The Eaters leave little behind but dust and unanswered questions.” He tapped his cane once on the stone. “The offer stands. For a time. Think on the value of order, carpenter’s boy.”

He turned and walked away, his form seeming to blend into the shifting shadows of the cavern wall.

Tilman’s hands were trembling. He had made his first true enemy: not a monster from a fable, but the very principle of the world he’d left behind, refined and distilled. The principle that demanded ownership, that saw seeking as a commodity. He had chosen his lattice. He was a ghost no longer.

That night, as he huddled in the smelly lean-to, the final test came. It began as a sound—a high, thin whine at the edge of hearing, like a taut wire vibrating. Then the smell: ozone and dead sea. The cook-fires guttered. The murmurs in the camp died.

Lotte was at the lean-to entrance in an instant, her spear in hand. “Eaters. At the West Corridor mouth. Korbinian’s rallying a line.”

“What do I do?” Tilman asked, scrambling up.

“You stay here. Guard the children and the old ones. This isn’t your fight.”

But it was. He had chosen this lattice. He had drawn the attention of Valerius. He was part of the connection they sought to fray. He pushed past her, out into the open.

The West Corridor entrance was a scene of silent, desperate struggle. Korbinian and a half-dozen others stood in a ragged line, holding not swords, but objects: a mirrored shield, a burning branch that gave off no heat, a large, ringing bell. They were pushing back against an advancing wall of grey, shifting mist. The mist seemed to absorb light and sound. Where it touched the stone floor, the solid rock didn’t crumble, but became indistinct, like a memory of stone. The high whine was emanating from it, a sound that made Tilman’s teeth ache and his thoughts scatter.

He saw a tendril of the mist curl around the mirrored shield. The reflection within it smeared, then emptied, showing not the cavern, but a formless, hungry grey. The woman holding the shield cried out, a sound of profound disorientation, and stumbled back.

They were losing. They were fighting negation with symbols, and the symbols were being un-made.

Tilman’s hand went to the compass fragment. It was ice-cold. It gave no direction, no clever solution. It was just a piece of a thing that sought.

He was a maker. He understood joinery. He understood connection.

He didn’t charge. He ran to the pile of materials by the communal fire—scraps of wood, bits of cloth, cord. His hands moved without conscious thought, driven by a desperate, intuitive grammar. He grabbed a piece of the dark, dense wood from the repaired lintel, a strip of iridescent cloth, a length of gut-string. He didn’t carve. He *bound*. He wrapped the cloth around the wood, lashed it tight with the cord, not in a random pattern, but in a series of knots that spoke of binding, of securing, of holding fast. He poured into it the intention of his repair on the lintel—the sharing of load, the clarification of purpose. He made a crude, ugly talisman of connection.

He ran to the line, ducking under Korbinian’s arm. He didn’t throw the bundle at the mist. He held it out, directly in the path of the advancing tendril.

The effect was not a blast of light. It was a localised assertion. The tendril of mist recoiled, not as if burned, but as if confronted with a solid object in a space where solidity had been diluted. Where the talisman pointed, the grey receded, the stone beneath it snapping back into sharp, real focus. The high whine faltered.

“Now!” Korbinian roared.

The others pressed their symbols forward. The bell rang with a clear, defining note. The cold-fire branch flared. The mirrored shield, its surface clearing where the mist had pulled back, reflected the line of defenders themselves—a definition of *us* against the formless *them*. The grey wall shuddered, then began to withdraw, flowing back into the corridor from whence it came, leaving behind patches of floor that looked worn, dreamt-of, but intact.

Silence returned, heavy and panting.

Lotte stood beside Tilman, staring at the smouldering, disintegrating bundle in his hand. The cloth was ash, the cord frayed to nothing, the piece of dark wood now cracked and dry, its purpose spent.

“You’re an idiot,” she breathed. But her hand clapped his shoulder, a brief, hard impact of acknowledgement.

Korbinian walked over, his face etched with exhaustion and something like respect. “You held the line. You defined a space.” He looked at the ruined talisman. “A maker indeed.”

Tilman’s knees gave way and he sat heavily on the cold stone. He was trembling all over. He had faced the formless enemy and had not run. He had used the only language he had. He had found a place, not just in the Shallows, but in himself.

Later, as the camp settled into a wary quiet, Korbinian sat with him by the fire. “You consolidated something today. For them, and for you. You’re part of the lattice here now. That comes with a price. Valerius won’t forget. The Eaters will remember the taste of your intention. And your door… it will be harder to find now. Seeking draws the attention of everything.”

Tilman nodded, staring into the flames. The compass fragment was warm against his skin, a steady, patient pulse. He had learned to survive the between. He had found reluctant allies. He had identified his true enemy. He had passed a test and cemented a fragile belonging.

But as he looked around at the huddled, resilient forms in the firelight, at the great, aching ribs of stone holding up the dark, he understood the final, cruel truth of his seeking.

He had gained a compass. He had gained a place. But the door he sought, the answer to the question he carried, now lay somewhere beyond a gauntlet of owned thresholds and hungry, meaning-less grey. He had traded the simple, solid yoke of his father’s yard for a path that led into a deeper, more intricate dark. And the only tools he had to navigate it were his two hands, and a fragment of a thing that only knew how to want.

# Chapter 5

## **Chapter 5**

The quiet in the Shallows after the burning was a different thing. It was not the absence of sound, but a held breath, a collective listening to the echoes of a shout that had been flung into the formless grey. The camp moved with a new, wary rhythm around Tilman. Looks were no longer merely curious or dismissive; they held a measure, a calculation. He had defined a space. He was part of the lattice. The weight of it was a colder, denser thing than the rain of Cologne.

Three days passed in a brittle parody of routine. Mending nets from the ghost-river. Boiling glue from hooves that weren’t quite hooves. Korbinian moved among them like a tired surgeon, assessing supplies, testing the edges of their shared intention. The air tasted of damp stone and burnt thyme.

On the fourth morning, he gathered them at the fire-pit, its embers a low, red heartbeat. Lotte sat sharpening a hook made of bone, the scrape of stone on keratin setting Tilman’s teeth on edge. A few others clustered close—Elmar, with his perpetual squint, and a woman named Anika whose hands were mapped with fine, silver scars.

“We can’t just wait for the next push,” Korbinian began, his voice gravelly with fatigue. “The Eaters will come again, and they’ll come for the taste he left in the air.” He didn’t look at Tilman, but the designation was clear. *He*. The new thing. The maker. “Valerius’s hold on the old chapter-house tightens. He consolidates meaning there, hoards it, distorts it. It’s a knot. And knots like that draw the grey, give it shape. It’s the source of the pressure we feel.”

Lotte stopped scraping. “The chapter-house. You’re talking about the Archivum.”

“It’s what it was. Now it’s his keep. His well.”

A low murmur travelled through the small group. Tilman felt the compass fragment against his chest, a warm, insistent counterpoint to the chill seeping up from the stone floor. The Archivum. The name resonated in the hollow of his memory, a place from Korbinian’s earlier, fragmented stories. A repository. A place of answers.

“What’s in it?” Tilman asked. His own voice sounded strange to him, less hesitant.

“Fragments,” Korbinian said. “Remnants of codices, palimpsests of journeys, maps of intentions that failed or succeeded. The leavings of a hundred seekers. Valerius was a librarian, once. Before he decided that collecting stories was less potent than controlling the endings. He’s built a fortress of other people’s seeking. He uses the weight of their questions to anchor his own dominion.”

“And you think my door… the answer I’m looking for… could be in there?”

Korbinian met his gaze. “I think it’s the only place left to look that isn’t just more wandering. The Shallows are a margin. The Archivum is a text. If your answer exists anywhere as more than a whisper, it’s there. Buried under his curation.”

The plan, such as it was, unfolded like a grim origami. The Archivum wasn’t far in terms of steps, but it existed behind layers of owned threshold. Valerius had woven permissions and warnings into the very approach, a psychic barbed wire. They would need to move through a zone of concentrated forgetting, a place where the grey didn’t just press, but actively unravelled.

“We go at the turn of the watch,” Korbinian said. “When his attention is most inward, cataloguing his acquisitions. Lotte knows a servant’s passage, a crack in the intention. It’s narrow. It will… test us.”

Lotte nodded, her face grim. “It’s a throat. And it tries to swallow.”

The fire popped, sending up a spiral of sparks that died before they touched the cavern ceiling. The planning continued, a dry recitation of dangers and contingencies, but Tilman heard the unsaid thing beneath it. They were going to storm a library. They were going to fight over meaning itself. He looked at his hands, still stained with the soot of the burnt talisman. The only tools he had.

***

The hours bled away, thick and slow as cold oil. The camp prepared in quiet, methodical movements. Bundles of food that tasted of dust and roots. Waterskins. Slivers of soapstone that could hold a flame. Anika distributed small, rough-woven pouches of salt and iron filings.

Tilman found himself at the edge of the ghost-river, watching the slow, silent curl of waters that had no source. The trembling in his bones had settled into a deep, resonant hum. He was afraid, but it was a clean fear, a sharp stone in his boot. It was the other thing that choked him—the doubt, not of his courage, but of his right.

A shadow fell across the illusory water. Lotte sat beside him, not speaking for a long moment. The constant, abrasive energy around her was muted.

“You’re thinking you’ll get them all killed,” she said finally, not looking at him.

“The thought occurred.”

She snorted. “It’s a vanity. We were dead the moment we washed up here. This is just choosing the shape of it. Korbinian’s been waiting for a lever. For something new to throw at the walls of that place. You’re it.”

“A tool.”

“A nail,” she corrected. “You’re the thing he hammers. Don’t flatter yourself that it’s more personal.”

He picked up a pebble, felt its impossible smoothness. “Why do you stay with him?”

For the first time, he saw her hesitate. Her jaw worked. “He found me when I was nothing but a scream in a ditch. I didn’t know my name. I was just… outrage. He gave it a shape. A purpose. Told me my anger was a compass, too, if I’d learn to read it.” She looked at him, her eyes hard. “He’s using you. But he’s not lying. The Archivum is real. Your answer might be there. That’s the trade. Don’t get poetic about it.”

She stood up, brushing non-existent dirt from her trousers. “The tension’s rising. Elmar’s talking about portents in the glue bubbles. Anika’s gone quiet. They’re remembering what it’s like to have something to lose again. A community. Even this one.” She jabbed a finger at him. “You made that. That’s your doing. So tonight, when the fear sets in, that’s yours to carry, too.”

She walked away, leaving him with the weight of it. It was heavier than the cart, heavier than the yoke. It was the weight of other people’s hope, a fragile, desperate thing he hadn’t asked for and didn’t know how to hold.

***

As the appointed hour bled closer, the tension in the Shallows did not so much rise as condense, like the greasy Cologne mist becoming rain. It settled in the corners of eyes, in the tightness of shoulders. Elmar muttered over his sleeping roll, his fingers tracing anxious patterns on the stone. Anika had indeed gone silent, sitting apart, polishing the same silver knife over and over until it gleamed with a cold, liquid light.

Tilman retreated to the alcove he now thought of as his own. The firelight from the main pit was a distant, flickering suggestion. Here, the dark was almost absolute, held back only by the faint, phosphorescent drip of moisture along one wall. He sat with his back against the cold stone, the compass fragment a steady pulse against his sternum.

This was the quiet reflection, the moment before the step. But no grand clarity came. No vision of his father’s face, no ringing epiphany about the nature of doors. Instead, he was confronted by a simpler, more terrifying void: the fear of his own smallness.

He had fought the grey with a made thing. He had defined a space. But that was defence. Reaction. The Archivum was an assault on a curated reality. What if his making was just a child’s stick drawing, meaningless against the structured theology of a man like Valerius? What if his seeking was just a noise, and the door he sought was nothing but the exit from his own delusion?

The spiritual seeking was not a climb toward light. He saw that now. It was a descent into a cellar where every cherished truth was a jar on a shelf, and you had to break the jars to see what was inside, if anything. Korbinian sought to topple a tyrant of meaning. Lotte sought an outlet for her rage. What did Tilman seek? Not just a door home. That was the surface.

He sought *authority*. The authority to declare his own life a coherent text, and not just a pile of discarded, warped wood. His father’s yard had been a scripture of pure, unthinking function. The Shallows were a heretical marginalia. The Archivum was a corrupted canon. And he, Tilman, was trying to write a single, true sentence of his own in the space between them.

He took the compass fragment from his shirt. In the near-dark, it held no glow, just a rough, geometric shape against his palm. It didn’t point. It *wanted*. It was a fragment of desire. His own desire, to know, to return, to be, was the only engine he had. It was a weak flame. It was the only flame.

A shape filled the entrance to his alcove. Korbinian, outlined by the distant fire.

“It’s time,” he said, his voice low.

Tilman stood, his muscles stiff. He tucked the fragment away, its warmth seeping back into his skin. “I’m ready.”

Korbinian studied him in the gloom. “No, you’re not. But you’re willing. That’s the material we have.” He turned to go, then paused. “The door you seek, Tilman… it may not be behind his walls. But the key to recognising it might be. Remember that. We’re not looting for treasure. We’re searching for a single, correct word.”

***

The final approach began not with a march, but with a contraction. They left the Shallows in single file, a procession of shadows: Korbinian leading, then Lotte, Tilman, Anika, Elmar. They did not take the wider tunnels where the ghost-river ran, but slipped into a fissure so narrow Tilman had to turn his shoulders sideways. The stone here was different—smooth, almost glossy, as if worn down by the passage of something other than physical bodies.

The air changed. It grew thin, not in breath, but in substance. The comforting, solid smells of damp and fungus and smoke faded away, replaced by a hollow, metallic odour, like the inside of a bell that had never been rung. The light from their soapstone shards did not push the dark back so much as paint small, trembling islands on it, islands that the darkness seemed to resent.

This was the owned territory. The threshold. Tilman felt it as a pressure on his eardrums, a subtle, wrong tugging at the edges of his thoughts. It was trying to make him forget why he was here, to dissolve the sharp point of his intention into a vague, formless anxiety. He focused on the warm pulse against his chest, on the memory of grain under his plane, on the hard, real shape of Lotte’s pack ahead of him.

They walked for an hour, or a day. Time became granular, unreliable. The fissure wound downward, then turned sharply, and the walls fell away.

They emerged onto a ledge overlooking a vast, impossible space.

It was not a natural cavern. It was a negative cathedral. Great, ribbed buttresses of a stone so black it drank the light soared up into a vault of featureless grey mist. Below them, instead of a floor, was a churning, silent ocean of the same formless grey that pressed on the Shallows, but here it was concentrated, active, like a slow-motion whirlpool. And spanning this abyss, connecting to a great, dark structure built into the far wall, was a bridge.

It was not made of stone or wood. It was made of books.

Thousands upon thousands of them, bound in leather and vellum and worse things, fused together spine-to-cover, their pages splayed and interleaved to form a ragged, treacherous walkway. The bridge shuddered and undulated slightly, as if the books were breathing. At its far end loomed the Archivum. It had the stern, imposing architecture of a monastic fortress, but its windows glowed with a sickly, greenish light, and carved into its massive doors was not a saint or a cross, but a vast, open eye, its pupil a spiral of screaming faces rendered in minute, terrible detail.

“The Throat is beneath us,” Lotte whispered, her voice barely audible over the silent roar of the grey ocean. “We cross the Bridge of Drowned Voices. That’s the test. Each book… it’s a seeking that failed. A question that turned in on itself. They’re hungry for an ending. They’ll try to borrow yours.”

Korbinian pointed to a smaller, almost invisible archway to the left of the monstrous main doors. “The servant’s passage. There. We cross one at a time. Quickly. Don’t look down. Don’t stop. And whatever you hear, whatever promise it whispers, it is not yours. It is the echo of a shipwreck.”

He went first. He stepped onto the first book—a massive, mould-spotted folio—and the bridge seemed to sigh. He moved with a painful, deliberate speed, never rushing, never hesitating. Tilman saw the books near his feet shift, their pages curling like fingers. Halfway across, Korbinian faltered for a single step, his head tilting as if hearing a beloved voice, then he shook it violently and pressed on, disappearing into the shadow of the small arch.

Lotte went next, her passage swift and angry, as if defying the bridge to try her. It did. A cluster of small, gilt-edged volumes snapped at her ankles like dogs before subsiding.

Anika followed, serene and silent, the silver knife in her hand. Elmar went after, whimpering with each step, but he moved.

Then it was Tilman’s turn.

He stood at the edge. The chasm of hungry grey yawned beneath him. The bridge of books, a testament to failed seeking, waited. His spiritual seeking had brought him here, to the mouth of a negative cathedral, to walk on the corpses of other people’s questions. The escalation was complete. He had traded the simple dark of ignorance for this: a gauntlet of curated despair.

He took a breath, felt the compass fragment burn against his skin, a beacon of pure, undirected want.

He stepped onto the bridge.

The book under his foot—a waterlogged thing with covers of warped oak—let out a sound like a sob. He took another step, then another. The whispers began not in his ears, but in the marrow of his bones.

*…just lay down the tools, the seeking is the wound, lay down and be empty…*

*…I found it, I found the answer, it’s here, just stop and look, just open me…*

*…your father is waiting, he understands now, he’s just on the other side of this page…*

The promises were exquisite, tailored. They spoke to the very core of his fatigue, his loneliness, his doubt. They offered the peace of surrender, the solace of an answer, the forgiveness he craved. The books beneath him strained upwards, pages rustling with a desperate, loving hunger. They wanted to close around him, to make him their final, perfect sentence.

He fixed his eyes on the small archway. He thought not of answers, but of the making. The feel of the wood grain. The smell of fresh shavings. The *action* of creation, not its end. He was not a question seeking an answer. He was a hand seeking to shape.

He was halfway across when the bridge beneath him erupted.

Not with violence, but with a violent, overwhelming surge of *meaning*. A wave of concentrated intention—not his own—slammed into him. It was Valerius’s attention, finally turning outward. It was the gaze of the carved eye on the door, focused and aware.

The grey ocean below seethed. The Bridge of Drowned Voices screamed in unison, a psychic shatter of a thousand broken epiphanies. The books writhed, their bindings cracking.

And from the small, servant’s archway, a figure emerged.

Not Korbinian. Not a guard.

It was a boy. Perhaps twelve years old. Naked, pale as a grub, his eyes were empty pools of the same featureless grey. He walked to the edge of the archway platform and stood, head cocked, looking at Tilman across the remaining twenty yards of convulsing bridge.

He opened his mouth. The voice that came out was a pristine, beautiful choir, and it was the voice of the grey, given perfect, devastating form.

“Tilman,” it sang. “We have been waiting. Your seeking is so loud. So delicious. You made a space. We have made a space for you, inside. We will give your question a beautiful, silent home. You will be our favourite book.”

It was the Eaters. They had not just remembered his taste. They had learned to speak with it. They had woven his own longing into a lure, and they had arrived at the threshold first.

The spiritual seeking had reached its zenith, its terrible turning point. The enemy was no longer formless. It had found his voice. And it was using it to call him by name.

Tilman stood frozen on the screaming bridge, the abyss below, the hollow angel before him, and the fragment of a compass burning a hole into his heart, wanting, wanting, wanting towards a door that might now be nothing but a mouth.

# Chapter 6

## **Chapter 6**

The voice was a hook in the meat of his mind. It did not pull, but held, a perfect, paralyzing barb. It was his own hunger, given melody. The wanting that had driven him from his father’s shop, that had gnawed at him through the rain-slick streets of Cologne, that had festered in the silence of the scriptorium—it was all there, sung back to him in a choir of angels. It promised satiation. It promised an end to the quest. A beautiful, silent home. To be a book upon their shelf was to have his question answered by becoming the answer itself, a closed and finished thing. The temptation was a physical warmth in his gut, a seductive counterpoint to the screaming cold of the bridge.

The bridge itself was coming apart. Not in stone and mortar, but in sense. The grey ocean below was no longer water but a rising tide of pure, undifferentiated signification, a soup of unmade meaning. The voices of the drowned were not screams of terror, but of a final, awful understanding—the moment the puzzle solves itself and in doing so, annihilates the solver. The books lashed to the railings strained at their bindings, pages fanning open like gills, desperate to drink the grey and be done.

The boy—the thing wearing a boy’s shape—took a step forward. Its bare feet made no sound on the wet stone. The featureless eyes were not blind. They were absorptive. They drank the light, the colour, the very definition from the air around it.

“Your noise is a beacon,” the choir-voice sighed, a sound of exquisite pity. “Your *why* is a lovely, jagged tear. Let us mend it. Let us make you smooth.”

Tilman’s hand went to his chest, where the shard of the compass lay against his skin. It was no longer warm. It was a point of searing cold, a negative burn. It *wanted*. It wanted so fiercely it felt like hatred. It wanted the door, the truth, the centre. It did not want the smooth, silent peace the grey thing offered. The conflict was a torsion in his ribs, a war between two kinds of hunger: one that desired an end, and one that desired only the desire itself.

A sound tore through the psychic cacophony—a raw, human shout, stripped of all music.

“*Tilman! Look at me!*”

Korbinian. He stood in the main archway, backlit by the turbulent light of the chamber beyond. He had a guard’s short spear in his hands, but he held it like a staff, like a man trying to ward off a wolf. His face was the colour of old cheese, his eyes wide with a terror that was, miraculously, not for himself.

“It’s a reflection!” he bellowed, his voice straining against the beautiful song. “It’s a *mire*! It shows you what you want to see to drown you! Don’t listen to its grammar!”

Grammar. The word, so absurd, so specific, was a splinter of reality. It was a craftsman’s word. The grey thing’s head swiveled toward Korbinian with the slow, indifferent grace of a owl. It opened its mouth again.

“You are a footnote,” the choir sang, sweetly dismissive. “A smudge of ink. We will blot you.”

Korbinian flinched as if struck, but he set his feet. “I’ve been a smudge my whole life, you pearlescent bastard. Try harder.”

The distraction was a fissure in the spell. Tilman wrenched his gaze from the hollow boy. The door. The great, carved door of Valerius’s sanctum was still there, twenty yards behind the creature. The eye in its centre was open wide, and from it poured not light, but a profound and focused *attention*. It was the opposite of the grey’s absorptive void. It was a beam, a scrutiny. It was the master of the tower, finally looking out, and his gaze fell upon the chaos of his bridge, upon the servant, upon the intruder, and upon the thing that wore a child’s skin.

The gaze was not friendly. It was the cold, assessing stare of a man viewing an infestation in his carefully ordered workshop. But it was a *point*. A direction. The compass shard flared with a pain that was almost sweet, yanking Tilman’s soul toward that door.

He moved. Not away from the grey child, but laterally, toward the railing of the bridge where the books convulsed. His body felt like warped oak, stiff and unresponsive. Each step was a battle against the lullaby in his skull.

“The seeking is the wound,” the boy sang, turning back to him, taking another step. Its voice was closer now, inside his ear canal. “Let us heal it. Be our book. Be complete.”

Tilman’s fingers closed on the sodden, heaving binding of the nearest book. It was a psalter. The vellum wept a thin, grey fluid. He did not try to read it. He tore it from its iron staple. It was surprisingly heavy, dense with swallowed meaning.

“I am not a question,” Tilman gasped, the words ripped from him, a defiance not of the creature, but of the part of himself that yearned for its promise. “I am a *hand*.”

He hurled the book not at the boy, but into the air over the railing, into the seething grey abyss.

The effect was instantaneous and catastrophic. The grey ocean flared, as if stung. A thousand voices screamed in ecstatic agony. The book was not falling; it was being *unmade*, its text dissolving, its illuminations bleeding into the uniform void, a drop of colour vanishing in a vast, hungry bleach. The creature on the bridge shuddered, a ripple of pleasure-pain passing through its pale form. Its attention, for a fraction of a second, followed the book down.

Tilman ran.

He did not run for the door. He ran for Korbinian. The logic was not thought, but instinct—the instinct of the workshop. You do not present your back to the hungry thing. You put a solid bench between you and it. Korbinian, spear levelled, was the only bench on the bridge.

The grey boy’s head snapped back. Its beautiful mouth curved into a smile of infinite patience. “The page turns,” it sang.

It moved.

It did not walk. It *flowed*, a pale smear across the wet stones. It was before Korbinian in an eyeblink. The guard’s spear thrust out, a clean, professional lunge. The point took the creature in the centre of its chest. There was no resistance. No wound. The spearhead simply vanished into the pale flesh as into thick mist, and the haft began to dissolve, the wood turning soft, then mealy, then grey, the corruption racing back toward Korbinian’s hands.

Korbinian cried out, dropping the dissolving weapon. The grey thing reached for him. Its touch was not violent. It was a caress. Its fingers brushed the man’s cheek.

Korbinian’s scream was not of pain, but of erasure. Where the fingers touched, his worry, his fear, his loyalty—the specific *Korbinian-ness* of him—began to smooth away. His eyes went wide and blank, his jaw slack. He was becoming a footnote, being blotted out.

“No!” The roar came from Tilman’s throat, raw as a saw on green wood. He was there, grabbing Korbinian by the back of his tunic, heaving him backward. The grey thing’s hand fell away, leaving a patch of waxy, featureless skin on the guard’s face.

Tilman shoved Korbinian behind him, toward the sanctum door. The man stumbled, moaning, clutching his face.

Now Tilman stood alone, facing the creature in the narrowing space between the screaming bridge and the door. The full force of its attention settled on him. The choir-voice softened to a whisper that vibrated in his teeth.

“Our favourite book. Let us read you. Let us be your end.”

The wanting from the compass shard was a fire in his heart. The wanting from the song was a frost in his veins. They met in a silent, shattering concussion. This was the central obstacle, the life-or-death struggle. Not a monster to be fought, but a truth to be refused. The enemy was his own spiritual exhaustion, given form and a sweet, singing tongue. To continue seeking was agony. To stop was annihilation.

He had no weapon. No holy words. He had only the tools he had always had: his hands, and the habit of making.

As the pale boy reached for him, Tilman did not retreat. He reached into the sack at his belt. His fingers closed not around the compass shard, but around a lump of beeswax, a crude lump of iron gall ink, a folded parchment. The mundane tools of his stolen trade.

The creature’s hand hovered an inch from his forehead. The chill of it numbed his skin.

Tilman looked past it, past the beautiful, hollow face, to the raging grey behind it. He saw not an ocean, but a surface. A blank page. The greatest, most terrible page imaginable.

“You want my story?” Tilman whispered, his voice hoarse, the voice of a man in a dusty shop. “You want to make me smooth?”

He brought his hands up, the wax and the ink held before him like pathetic offerings. He met the thing’s empty eyes.

“Then *read this*.”

He smashed the lump of wax and the cake of ink together in his fist, and with the mess of it, he made a mark. A single, crude, defiant smudge on the empty air between them.

It was not a letter. It was not a sigil. It was the opposite of the grey’s perfect, silent resolution. It was a *beginning*. It was the first, ugly, necessary mistake on the path to a thing made. It was the proof of a hand at work.

The grey boy recoiled.

It was a tiny motion, a flinch. But it was a crack in the perfect façade. The beautiful song hiccupped. The featureless eyes looked at the black-and-yellow smear hanging in the mist, and for a moment, they reflected not nothing, but a faint, confused distortion.

It was not hurt. It was *offended*. The grammar was wrong. This was not a seeking to be ended. This was a making being begun. In the presence of its pure, finished silence, Tilman was insisting on a noisy, messy, unresolved process.

The creature’s mouth opened wider, the choir-voice gathering into a single, piercing note of negation. It was a sound that sought to unscramble thought, to un-write the smudge.

Tilman used the moment. He ducked under the reaching arm, not toward the safety of the door, but back toward the railing. He grabbed another book, a massive, groaning tome lashed with iron bands. He did not throw this one. He wedged it against the railing, a shield of frantic, captured meaning between him and the song.

The note hit the book. The leather cover greyed and crumbled. But inside, a thousand voices, a thousand finished thoughts, screamed in unison as they were unmade. The book dissolved, but it took the force of the note with it, buying a second. Another. A third.

Tilman was a carpenter’s son. He understood leverage. He understood using the enemy’s weight against itself. The grey wanted to consume meaning. So he fed it. He wrenched books from their staples, one after another, a sacrificial offering of completed quests, of answered questions. Each one was a mouthful for the void, a momentary distraction. The bridge shuddered with the agony of their dissolution. The grey boy stood amidst the storm of unmaking, its song constant, its expression now one of focused, hungry irritation.

He was halfway back to the door, a trail of disintegrating pages in his wake, when his hand closed on a book that did not writhe. It was small, bound in plain, undyed leather. It was cold. It was silent. It was the book he had taken from the dead scribe in the lower scriptorium. The one that held nothing but a single, repeating word.

*Nichts. Nichts. Nichts.*

Nothing.

Tilman stared at it. The grey boy took a step, then another, the space between them closing. The song shifted, becoming coaxing again, a lover’s plea. “No more struggle. No more tools. Only peace.”

He looked at the book of nothing. He looked at the creature of nothing, wearing a stolen voice.

A terrible, crystalline understanding fell into place. His greatest fear was not of the grey, nor of the Eaters. It was of his own irrelevance. Of being a bad son, a failed apprentice, a seeker who found only dust. Of being, in the end, *nothing*. The grey had found that fear and woven it into the lure. It promised to make his fear a comfort. To make his nothingness a permanent, peaceful home.

The creature was within ten feet. Five. Its hand extended, fingers poised to touch his chest, to smooth the wanting heart within.

This was the dark moment. The flaw laid bare. The seeker faced with the truth of his own emptiness, offered a sanctuary within it. The compass shard was silent. The door behind him was just wood and stone. Korbinian was a weeping ruin. The books were gone. He had only the empty book in his hand.

He seemed to sag. The fight went out of his shoulders. He lowered his head, a gesture of surrender.

The grey boy’s song swelled in triumph. “Yes. Be our book.”

Tilman’s thumb stroked the cold leather cover. *Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.*

He looked up, and his eyes were not defeated. They were the eyes of a man who has seen the bottom of the abyss and decided it is just another kind of material.

“I am not nothing,” he said, his voice quiet, flat, final. “I am the *maker* of nothing.”

He opened the book.

He did not throw it. He held it open, facing the creature, and he *read* from it. He spoke the word, not as a surrender, but as a declaration. As a craftsman naming his material.

“*Nichts*.”

The word left his lips and did not vanish into the grey. It hung there, a solid, declared absence. A shaped void.

The grey boy stopped. The choir choked. The beautiful features contorted, not in pain, but in a profound, ontological confusion. It was a thing that *was* nothing, that fed on the transition from something to nothing. It could not consume a nothing that was presented as a *made thing*. It was a mirror being shown its own reflection. A vacuum meeting a declared vacuum.

It hesitated. In that hesitation, the absolute certainty of its purpose faltered.

Tilman did not hesitate. He dropped the book. It fell to the stones with a slap. He charged, not with a weapon, but with his body, his whole, unresolved, yearning, flawed self. He slammed into the pale creature.

There was no impact of flesh. It was like plunging into a bank of freezing, mindless fog. The song became a deafening shriek inside his skull. The grey closed around him. He felt his memories being sorted, his desires tasted, his fears unfolded like fine linen. He felt the smoothing begin. The comforting silence beckoned.

He focused on one thing. Not the door. Not the compass. Not even his own name.

He focused on the feel of a chisel in his hand. The grit of oak dust under his nails. The smell of linseed oil on a rainy afternoon. The *action* of shaping. The process. The beautiful, endless, frustrating *noise* of making.

He made himself a knot of unresolved process in the heart of the resolving void.

The grey recoiled. It was not a physical recoil, but a spiritual convulsion. The fog expelled him. He stumbled back, falling to his knees on the wet stone, gasping as if he had been drowning. The pale boy-form staggered, its edges blurring. The beautiful voice fractured into a cacophony of discordant whispers—snippets of swallowed prayers, half-remembered theories, the last thoughts of the drowned.

It was not defeated. It was *contaminated*. Confused. It looked at its own hands as if seeing them for the first time, and they began to waver, like a reflection in troubled water.

From the great door behind him, a new sound cut through the chaos: the deep, resonant *clunk* of a heavy iron bolt being drawn back.

The carved eye in the door blinked.

The grey creature’s head snapped toward the sound. Its confusion sharpened into something like alarm. The sanctum was opening. The attention from within was focusing, solidifying into a will.

With a sound like a sigh of infinite regret, the pale form unraveled. It did not flee. It simply came apart, dissolving into the general grey of the churning abyss below, its stolen voice merging back into the wordless scream of the drowned.

The Bridge of Drowned Voices fell silent. The books stopped writhing. The grey ocean subsided into a mere, gloomy mist far below.

The ordeal was over.

Tilman knelt, trembling, his forehead pressed to the cold, wet stone. He had not fought with strength or cunning. He had overcome by being what he was, stubbornly and entirely: a maker, not a finder. A hand, not an answer. He had offered the Eaters not a soul to consume, but a workshop to get lost in. And they had found it… indigestible.

A shadow fell over him. He looked up.

Korbinian stood there, one hand still pressed to the waxy, smooth patch on his cheek. His other hand was outstretched. His eyes, though haunted, were his own.

“Up,” the guard grunted, his voice sandpaper-rough. “Before it rethinks its lunch.”

Tilman took his hand and pulled himself up. They stood together, two battered, insignificant things on the empty bridge, before the door that was now ajar.

A slice of golden light, warm and steady, fell from the opening, cutting through the Cologne gloom. It was the light of a well-trimmed lamp, of a clean fire. It was the most ordinary, most miraculous thing Tilman had seen since he’d left home.

From within, a voice spoke. It was an old man’s voice, dry, precise, and thick with an irritation that had been brewing for centuries.

“Well?” it said. “Are you going to stand out there in the metaphysical weather all night, or are you coming in to explain why you have used several dozen of my archived epistemologies as projectile weapons against a psychic parasite?”

Tilman and Korbinian exchanged a glance. There was no triumph in it. Only a shared, bone-deep weariness, and a flicker of wary hope.

They had earned their reward. An audience. Not with a saint or a wizard, but with a profoundly annoyed scholar who had just watched them vandalize his library.

Tilman adjusted his sodden cloak, ran a hand through his hair—a futile gesture—and stepped toward the light.

The chamber within was not large. It was a workshop. But where Tilman’s father’s workshop had been a chaos of wood and glue and ambition, this was a chaos of a higher order. Shelves rose to a shadowed ceiling, crammed not with books, but with *objects*: astrolabes of brass and shadow, glass orbs containing miniature, frozen storms, articulated skeletons of creatures that had never lived, sheaves of drawings that seemed to move at the corner of the eye. The air smelled of ozone, old parchment, and a sharp, coppery scent Tilman couldn’t name.

At a broad, scarred table of black oak in the centre of the room sat Valerius.

He was not what Tilman had expected. He was not a gaunt, fiery-eyed prophet. He was a small, tidy man with a close-cropped fringe of white hair around a bald pate. He wore a simple, ink-stained smock over a woolen tunic. He had the strong, stubby fingers of a scribe or a clockmaker. He was examining a complex device of interlocking rings through a jeweller’s loupe, and he did not look up as they entered.

“Close the door,” he said, still peering through the glass. “You’re letting the nonsense in.”

Korbinian shoved the heavy door shut. The carved eye on the outside closed with a soft, final *thud*. The screaming silence of the bridge was replaced by the dense, busy silence of profound concentration.

Valerius put down his loupe and looked at them. His eyes were a pale, watery blue, and they held no mystery, only a deep, impatient intelligence. They scanned Korbinian, dismissed him with a slight frown at the waxy cheek, and settled on Tilman.

“You,” he said. “The seeker with the loud wanting. The one who poked the nest. You have a fragment of my compass.”

It was not a question. Tilman’s hand went to his chest. He nodded, unable to find words.

“Give it here.”

Tilman fumbled the leather cord over his head. He stepped forward and placed the warm, humming shard of slate on the table beside the device of rings.

Valerius picked it up, held it to the lamplight. He grunted. “Broken. Of course. Nothing comes to my door whole.” He looked at Tilman again. “You used it. You felt its pull. What did it want?”

Tilman swallowed. “The centre. The truth.”

“Pfah.” Valerius tossed the shard back onto the table with a clatter. “Compasses don’t want truth. They want alignment. This one was made to find a specific kind of… attunement. A state of being. You’ve been dragging it toward your own spiritual heartburn, and it’s been dragging you toward the nearest thing that smells like resolution. Which, on this bridge, happens to be the digestive tract of the Eaters of Certainty. You are very lucky you are so stubbornly unfinished. It made you taste bad.”

Tilman stared. The grand spiritual quest, the burning need, reduced to a case of metaphysical indigestion. He felt a hysterical laugh bubble in his throat, which he choked into a cough.

“Why did you come?” Valerius asked, his tone suggesting this was the only marginally interesting question.

“The… the *Liber Figurarum*,” Tilman managed. “The book of the Unmaking. I was told you… that it might be here. That you might know.”

Valerius went very still. The busy silence of the room deepened. He leaned back in his chair, the wood creaking.

“Who told you this?”

“A man. A scholar. He is dead now. The grey… they took him.”

“They are taking many,” Valerius said softly, almost to himself. He looked at the closed door, as if he could see through it to the bridge beyond. “They are growing bold. Learning. Using our own seeking against us.” His gaze returned to Tilman, sharpened. “And you think this book is an answer? A weapon?”

“I think it is a reason my father was killed,” Tilman said, the words hard and clear in the warm air. “I think it is a thing that should not be. I have to know.”

“To know,” Valerius echoed. He stood up, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a small, iron-bound chest. He brought it to the table, unlocked it with a key from his belt. Inside, on a bed of faded velvet, lay a single key. It was long, thin, made of a dull, non-reflective metal. It looked less like a key for a lock and more like a key for a wound.

“The *Liber Figurarum* is not here,” Valerius said. “It was never a book to be kept on a shelf. It is a process. A ritual of unmaking. A set of instructions for doing what you just did by accident—declaring a ‘nothing’ so perfectly it creates a vacuum that can swallow something. A dangerous, stupid thing.”

He picked up the key. “But the means to *find* where that ritual was last performed… that, I have. This key does not open a door. It opens a direction. It aligns with the residual… scar… left by the Unmaking. It is the other half of your broken compass.”

He held it out to Tilman. Not offering. Presenting.

“You have survived the threshold. You have faced the Eaters and, in your own clumsy way, understood their nature. You want this? You want to follow this path to its end, knowing it leads not to a truth, but to a crime scene? Knowing the things that are now aware of your taste will be waiting?”

Tilman looked at the key. It was the reward. The knowledge. The next step. It was also the hook in a different kind of flesh. He thought of his father’s still hands. Of the empty space on the workbench. Of the feeling of the chisel. He was not a question seeking an answer. He was a hand.

He took the key. It was cold, and it seemed to drink the warmth from his palm.

“Yes,” he said.

Valerius nodded, as if a mildly inconvenient experiment had yielded the expected result. “Good. Then you will leave. Tonight. The bridge will be quiet for a few hours. They are… digesting. Korbinian will see you to the river gate.”

“Master—” Korbinian began, his voice rough.

“Your service is discharged,” Valerius said, not unkindly. “You have been touched. You are a marked man now. Your only safety is in movement. Go with him. Be his bench. It seems to be a thing you are good at.”

Valerius turned back to his device of rings, picking up his loupe. The audience was over.

As Korbinian led him to a small, hidden postern gate in the chamber’s wall, Tilman paused. He looked back at the old man, bent in his pool of lamplight, already lost in a different puzzle.

“Why?” Tilman asked. “Why help?”

Valerius did not look up. “I am not helping you. I am pruning. A seeker like you, loose in the world, is a noisy, messy danger. A seeker on a specific trail is a contained variable. And your trail leads to the people who are *using* the Unmaking. The ones who are stirring up the grey, making it hungry, teaching it to speak. They are the real infestation. You, Tilman the carpenter’s son, are a very sharp tool. Go and be used.”

The postern gate opened onto a narrow, slimy stair that spiraled down through the thickness of the tower wall. It smelled of the river and rot. The sound of the real Rhine, water on stone, echoed up from below.

Korbinian lit a small lantern. His face in its light was grim, the waxy patch a stark moon on his cheek. “Where now?” he asked.

Tilman clutched the cold key in one hand. The compass shard, still on its cord, hung heavy around his neck. They pulled in different directions, a dissonant ache. The key pulled east, downriver. Towards the scar.

He looked down the dark stair, into the mundane, wet darkness. The spiritual seeking had turned. It was no longer a quest for light. It was a hunt for the makers of darkness. He had earned his reward: a direction, an ally, and a name for the enemy. Not the Eaters. The ones who fed them.

“Mainz,” Tilman said, the word leaving his lips like a vow. “We go to Mainz.”

And as he took the first step down, away from the tower of finished thoughts and into the hungry night, he felt the carved eye on the door behind him, not watching, but waiting. It had seen a tool be taken from the shelf. It would wait to see what, if anything, that tool managed to shape from the void.

# Chapter 7

## **Chapter 7**

The river at night was a different beast. By day, the Rhine was a road, a broad, muscular artery of commerce and current, its surface clotted with barges and its banks loud with the shouts of stevedores. By night, it shed that skin. It became a black, breathing void, a sound more felt than heard—a deep, wet sighing that seemed to rise from the stone of the quay itself. The mist off the water was colder now, tasting of silt and secrets, and it wrapped the two men and their small, hired skiff in a private, shifting shroud.

Korbinian worked the single stern oar with a ferryman’s tired efficiency, his bad eye a crater of shadow in the lantern’s weak halo. Tilman sat amidships, a bundle of damp wool and taut nerve, his hands resting on the rough planking between his knees. One hand still held the key, its metal warmed now to the temperature of his blood. The other absently traced the edge of the compass shard beneath his tunic. Mainz. The word was a stone in his gut. A direction, not a destination. A name on a map where a scar was.

They had not celebrated. There had been no victory. Valerius’s chamber, with its dust and its dreadful clarity, felt less like an inmost cave and more like a surgeon’s theatre. He had been laid open, his spiritual seeking not answered but *instrumentalized*. He had come seeking a cure for a sickness of the world, and had been handed a lancet and pointed towards the source of the infection. The reward was a weapon, and the weight of it was already a fatigue.

“He sees the world as a clock,” Tilman said, his voice swallowed by the river’s exhalation. “And people as gears. To be cleaned, or replaced.”

Korbinian grunted, adjusting the oar. “He sees what is. Most people see what they wish were. The first is colder. It is not always wrong.”

“And what are we? In his clock?”

“A loose pin,” Korbinian said after a moment. “Dropped into the works. To see what jams.”

The skiff slid past the last of Cologne’s waterfront torches, and the darkness became absolute, a tangible pressure. The lantern’s light did not push it back so much as carve out a tiny, floating cell of the visible. Tilman felt the vast, wet night at his back, and the memory of the grey, of its hungry, formless speech, coiled in the pit of his stomach. It was no longer a phantom. It was a tool, being used. The thought turned his blood to ice.

They made for a river-inn Korbinian knew, a low, sod-roofed hovel built on pilings where the bank softened into reed-bed. It was a place for those who did not wish to be seen by the city watch, or by anyone else. The innkeeper, a woman with forearms like ham hocks and a face that had long surrendered to permanent suspicion, took their coins and pointed wordlessly to a ladder leading to a loft under the eaves. The space was little more than a crawl-space, stinking of old hay and river-damp, but it was out of the weather and, more importantly, it had a single, shuttered window looking east, downriver.

Tilman placed the key on a rough-hewn beam by the window. In the lantern light, it was unremarkable. A piece of old iron, shaped by a simple, functional hand. No ornamentation, no mark of the locksmith. It was the key to a poor man’s chest, or a stable door. Yet Valerius had kept it among his celestial maps and whispering devices. Its cold pull was undeniable, a subtle, insistent tug in his mind’s eye, like the faintest of lodestones. East. Always east.

“What do you think it opens?” Korbinian asked, shrugging off his dripping cloak.

“Nothing good,” Tilman murmured. He thought of the scar on the world Valerius had shown him—a tear in the fabric of things, a place where the grey could seep in like damp through a cracked foundation. A key was for a lock. A lock was for a door. “A way in. Or a way out.”

Sleep, when it came, was thin and fractured. Tilman dreamed not of formless grey, but of sound. A low, rhythmic *thump*, like a great heart beating under the earth. And beneath it, a choir of whispers, not in a language he knew, but in the language of tools: the scrape of a plane on green wood, the *thock* of a chisel driven by a mallet, the sizzle of hot iron plunged into water. A symphony of making. But the things being made had no shape he could see, only a cold, sharp intention.

He woke to the grey, pre-dawn light leaking through the shutter slats. The key on the beam was a black silhouette. And it was humming.

Not a sound for the ear. A vibration in the teeth, in the marrow of the fingerbones that had held it. A faint, resonant frequency that spoke directly to the ache of the compass shard against his chest. He sat up, hay prickling through his tunic. Korbinian was already awake, his good eye fixed on the key, his body still.

“You feel it,” Tilman said. It was not a question.

“A pressure. Like before a storm.”

Tilman reached out, his fingers hovering an inch above the cold iron. The humming intensified, not in volume, but in *specificity*. It was no longer a single note. It was a chord, and within it, he could suddenly pick out strands. One was the clear, directional pull east, towards the scar. But there were others, fainter, diffused. One felt like the memory of Valerius’s tower—old stone, vellum, the scent of ozone. Another was sharp, acrid, a tang of corrupted metal and ambition. And the weakest of all, a thread so fine it was almost not there, felt like… home. Like the scent of pine resin and sawdust, like the quiet, solid presence of his father’s hands.

He snatched his hand back as if burned. The key was not just a pointer. It was a node. A thing connected to other things, to places and people. Valerius had not given him a map. He had given him the legend *for* a map, a cipher to decode the world itself. The true value of the reward was not the destination, but the lens. And the responsibility of it was immense. To feel these connections was to be aware of a vast, invisible web, and he was now a fly caught in its strands, feeling every tremor.

“It is linked,” he breathed, his voice raw. “To the tower. To the… the makers. And to my father’s workshop.”

Korbinian’s face was grave. “A spider feels its web. You hold a strand. The spider will feel you, too.”

The spiritual seeking had become a tangible net. He was no longer groping in the dark. He was in the dark, holding a live wire.

*

They bought passage at first light on a downriver barge carrying millstones from the Eifel. It was slow, ugly progress. The barge, a flat-bottomed tub laden with grim, grey discs of stone, wallowed in the current, its single square sail hanging limp in the damp air. The bargemen were a sullen lot, speaking in guttural curses as they poled away from snags and sandbars. The landscape unspooled on either bank—water-meadows giving way to steep, vineyard-terraced slopes, then to forests of dark fir that crowded down to the water’s edge as if drinking. It should have been majestic. To Tilman, it felt watched.

He stood at the stern, away from the crew, the key a secret weight in his pouch. He tried to quiet his mind, to feel for the threads. The eastern pull was a constant, taut line. The acrid thread was there too, a smear of wrongness on the horizon of his perception. But it was the faint, home-like thread that troubled him most. It was a whisper of peace, a memory of a world that was solid and knowable. A lure. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him, that it was a trap. The makers of the Unmaking would know of his father, of his origins. They would use that.

“They are not just ahead of us,” he said to Korbinian, who leaned against a millstone, sharpening his eating knife with a slow, steady rasp. “They are around us. The grey… it’s not just a weapon they fire. It’s a medium. A soil they have learned to till.”

Korbinian tested the edge of his blade with his thumb. “You sound like him now. The old man.”

“I feel it,” Tilman said, frustrated. “The key… it makes the connections visible. The world is not just matter. It is intention. And their intention is a stain, spreading.”

As if to confirm it, the consequence of the tower-ordeal manifested that afternoon.

The barge master, a man with a face like a clenched fist, ordered a halt at a ramshackle fishing village to take on fresh water. The place had a stillborn feel. No children played by the nets. No smoke rose from the hearths. An old woman sat on a stump, staring at the river with milky, unblinking eyes.

One of the bargemen, a younger man with a rash of boils on his neck, jumped ashore to fill a cask. As he passed the old woman, he made a sign against the evil eye, a quick, furtive gesture. She did not turn her head. But her mouth moved, forming soundless words.

The bargeman froze. The wooden cask dropped from his hands, rolling into the mud. He began to tremble, then to shake violently. His comrades called out, laughing at first, then falling silent. The man’s head snapped towards the barge, his eyes wide with a terror that was not his own. His mouth opened.

The voice that emerged was dry, papery, a chorus of whispers forced through a single throat. It spoke in no language Tilman knew, but the meaning was etched in the air like acid: *We see the tool. The cutter of threads. We are coming for the key.*

Then the man vomited a stream of black, oily water that smelled of the river’s deepest mud, and collapsed.

Silence, thick and choking, fell over the village and the barge. All eyes turned to Tilman and Korbinian. The barge master’s face went from red to a sickly grey. He pointed a shaking finger.

“Off,” he growled. “Off my boat. You and your ill luck. Now.”

No amount of coin would change his mind. The spiritual had bled into the mundane, and the mundane wanted no part of it. They were cast adrift, not just from the barge, but from the ordinary world of trade and travel. They stood on the muddy bank as the barge poled frantically back into the current, leaving them with the catatonic bargeman, the staring old woman, and the deepening twilight.

The enemy was not regrouping. It was announcing itself. The ordeal in the tower had not contained the variable; it had drawn a target on his back. The Eaters knew his purpose. And they could speak through the world itself.

Korbinian checked the fallen man’s pulse. “Alive. Empty.” He looked at the old woman. Her silent whispering had stopped. She was just an old woman again, vacant and lost. “They used the grey in her as a conduit. A whisper in a silent room. They have been here. This place is… fallow.”

Tilman felt a profound, soul-sick anger. Not a hot anger, but a cold one. This was the Unmaking. Not a grand, apocalyptic wave, but this slow, petty erosion. The theft of a man’s voice. The hollowing out of a village. The turning of a river’s sigh into a threat. It was a crime against the substance of things.

“We walk,” he said, his voice flat.

They gathered their meager packs. As they turned to follow the river road east, Tilman looked back once. The old woman had not moved. But her head was now tilted, as if listening to a distant sound. A sound only the hollowed-out could hear.

*

The road was a ribbon of churned mud between the river and the dark wall of the forest. They walked in a silence that was no longer companionable, but vigilant. Every rustle in the undergrowth, every groan of a tree in the wind, was a potential utterance. The ordinary world had become a membrane, stretched thin, and behind it, things that were not things pressed close, learning the shapes of words.

They made a cold camp in a lee of a rock outcrop, daring no fire. Korbinian took the first watch. Tilman lay back, the key held tight in his fist, the compass shard a cold brand on his chest. He let his awareness drift along the key’s threads, not seeking, just listening.

The eastern pull was a drumbeat now. The acrid thread was stronger, coiling like smoke. And then, he found a new thread. This one was not a location, but a *pattern*. A series of resonant points, a constellation of dull, aching nodes laid along the river valley. Places where the grey had pooled, where it had been used to *unmake* something specific. A boundary stone here, a village well there, a crossroads shrine further on. They were like stitches in the land, but stitches that were rotting, pulling the fabric apart. The work was not random. It was deliberate. Surgical. The makers were not just stirring up the grey; they were directing it, using it to cut specific threads in the tapestry of the world. To what end, he could not yet see, but the pattern was one of deliberate unraveling.

This was the final insight, the last gift of the reward. The key did not just open a door. It revealed the architecture of the lock. The spiritual seeking was over. He was not a seeker anymore. He was a cartographer of a spreading ruin.

When Korbinian shook him awake for his watch, the sky was beginning to pale from black to a bruised grey. The river murmured its old, indifferent song. Tilman sat with his back to the rock, the forest a wall of ink before him.

He had left the inmost cave. He had crossed the threshold back into the world. But the world was no longer the one he had left. It was thinner, louder with hidden voices, mapped with invisible scars. He was a man with a weapon he did not fully understand, walking a road towards an enemy who knew his name, followed by whispers in the mud. The hook was not in the next mystery, but in the unbearable clarity of the path ahead. He had a direction, an ally, a name for the enemy, and a key that showed him how the world was being taken apart, stitch by stitch.

And Mainz waited at the end of the road, not as a city, but as a wound. A scar on the world where all these cut threads were gathered, where the grey was not just seeping in, but being woven into something new. Something spoken into being.

He touched the key. It was silent now, cold iron. A tool. He was a tool. Valerius’s pruning had worked. The noisy, messy danger was now on a specific trail. And as the first, filthy light of dawn began to bleed into the sky, Tilman the carpenter’s son looked at his hands, and wondered what they would be forced to build from the void, and what they would have to break.

## **Chapter 8**

The forest was a cathedral of accusation. Every dripping branch, every root that snaked across the path, seemed to know what they carried. The key was a cold, heavy sin against Tilman’s chest, a second heart beating a slower, more deliberate rhythm than his own. It did not speak now, but its silence was a presence, a hole in the world that pulled at the grey. He could feel it, a subtle drag, like a lodestone for ruin.

Korbinian moved ahead, a shadow among shadows. The big man’s usual, rolling gait was gone, replaced by a hunter’s fluid silence. He did not look back. He had read the new map on Tilman’s face in the dawn light and had asked no questions. The seeking was done. What remained was flight.

They followed the river, but at a distance, using the thicker timber as a screen. The water’s song was no longer indifferent. To Tilman’s newly-tuned ear, it was a dirge, a low, wet chant that spoke of erosion, of patient, endless wearing-away. The spiritual seeking had honed his senses to a razor’s edge, but it was a blade turned inward, showing him not the face of God, but the anatomy of decay. He saw the scars now. A patch of ferns that grew a shade too pale, their fronds limp and whispering of salt. A stand of beech where the bark had split in perfect, spiraling fractures, as if the trees had been wrung out by a giant hand. The world was not just haunted; it was wounded. And they were moving through the infection, carrying a sliver of the knife.

The pursuit began not with a shout, but with a change in the quality of the air.

It was mid-morning, the mist burned off to a damp, green heat. The birds had fallen silent. Not the cautious quiet of a fox’s passing, but a complete cessation, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. Korbinian froze, one hand raised. Tilman felt it a moment later—a pressure, a greasy weight that settled on the skin like the Cologne rain. It was the feeling of being *known*. Not seen, but known, in the way a surgeon knows the body upon the table.

“Mud-whispers,” Korbinian breathed, the words barely stirring the air.

They came from the earth itself. Figures, perhaps a dozen, coalescing from the mulch and shadow at the base of the trees. They were not quite men. Their shapes were suggestions, blurred at the edges, as if they were reflections in troubled water. They wore the forest’s filth like a second skin—clods of leaf-litter, streaks of wet clay, twigs woven into the vague suggestion of limbs. Their faces were smooth, featureless pools of grey mud. They made no sound as they moved, but the ground sighed wetly under their weight.

The spiritual seeking had taught Tilman to listen for intent. These things had none. They were not hunters; they were instruments. A directed force, like the grey itself. They fanned out, a silent, closing net.

“Run,” Korbinian said, and it was not a suggestion.

They broke from the trees, angling down the slope toward the riverbank, where the undergrowth thinned and the ground was a treacherous slurry of gravel and silt. The mud-whispers flowed after them, their movement unnaturally fluid, sliding over obstacles rather than climbing them. Tilman’s breath sawed in his throat, the key pounding a cold counter-rhythm against his ribs. He risked a glance back. The things were gaining, not with speed, but with a terrible, relentless efficiency. They did not tire. They were the land itself, waking up to reject them.

The riverbank became a chase-ground. They splashed through icy shallows, scrambled over slick, algae-covered rocks. The mud-whispers followed, their footfalls silent, their grey forms darkening as the river’s water soaked into them, making them more solid, more real. One, closer than the rest, reached a long, dripping arm toward Tilman’s heel. He felt a wave of nullifying cold, a promise of stillness, of becoming mere matter again. He kicked out, his boot connecting not with flesh, but with a consistency like wet clay. The thing did not recoil. It simply absorbed the blow, its arm reforming around his ankle, pulling.

Korbinian was there. He did not strike the creature. He struck the ground at its feet with the haft of his axe, a sharp, percussive blow that seemed to *hurt* the earth. The mud-figure shuddered, its form loosening for a heartbeat. Tilman wrenched free, stumbling forward. They ran on, the river’s roar growing louder as it funneled into a rocky defile.

“The bridge,” Korbinian gasped. “The old Roman one. Cross it. They dislike worked stone.”

Tilman saw it ahead—a hump-backed relic of another age, two arches of weathered, moss-furred stone spanning a narrower, fiercer stretch of the river. It was their threshold. Beyond it, the road to Mainz proper began.

They reached the near bank, their boots slipping on the stone approach. The mud-whispers halted at the tree line, a silent, grey rank. They did not venture onto the cleared ground before the bridge. They simply watched with their blank, wet faces.

“Go,” Korbinian said, shoving Tilman onto the first arch. “Don’t stop.”

Tilman ran, the worn soles of his boots skidding on the damp stone. He was halfway across when he heard the sound behind him—not a footfall, but a wet, tearing crunch, like a root pulling free from deep soil.

He turned.

They had not followed. They had *changed*. The dozen grey figures were flowing together, merging like droplets of quicksilver, piling upon one another in a silent, terrifying sculpture. They rose into a single, towering form, a crude giant of mud and leaf-mould and river-silt. It had no features, only a blunt, rounded head that turned slowly toward the bridge. It took a step forward. The ground trembled.

Korbinian stood between it and the bridge, his axe in his hands. He looked small before the thing, a man before a landslide given purpose.

“Korbinian!” Tilman shouted.

“The key shows you the lock, boy!” the big man roared, not turning. “Now go read it! This is just a door!”

The mud-giant swung a limb like a falling tree. Korbinian did not try to block it. He dropped, rolling beneath the blow, and came up swinging his axe not at the giant, but at the stone base of the nearest bridge arch. The steel bit into ancient mortar with a spray of sparks and dust. It was a futile gesture. Then he did it again. And again.

The giant turned, ponderous, and reached for him.

Tilman understood. It was not an attack. It was a distraction. A noisy, messy danger drawing the eye. Valerius’s pruning. Korbinian was making himself the only thing the instrument could see, the only thread it could try to cut.

The spiritual seeking was over. This was not a moment for revelation, but for sacrifice. The choice was not his to make; Korbinian had already made it. The greater good was the key, and the map it carried in its silence. The greater good was the scar of Mainz, and whatever waited there.

Tilman’s throat closed. He took one step back, then another. His hands, the carpenter’s hands that wondered what they would build, were empty. He could only break. He turned and ran, the sound of axe on stone and the wet, earth-shaking impacts chasing him across the bridge.

He broke from the far side onto a rutted track that wound south through fields. He did not look back. He ran until his lungs were fire and the world was a grey blur. When he finally stumbled to a halt, leaning against a mossy wayside cross, the only sound was the distant, mocking rush of the river, and the ragged tear of his own breath.

He was alone. The key was cold against his skin. The ally was gone. The path ahead was unbearably clear, and terribly light. He had crossed the final barrier, escaped the special world of the forest and its whispering wounds. He was heading for home, if home was a wound in the world.

The road to Mainz lay open before him, a brown ribbon stitching through the green. The spiritual seeking had ended not in communion, but in a terrible, clarifying solitude. He was a cartographer of ruin, and his first and only landmark was the place where all the cut threads were gathered. He touched the key. It was a tool. He was a tool. And as the afternoon light began to fail, bleeding into a familiar, greasy twilight, Tilman the carpenter’s son started walking, the ghost of an axe-strike on stone echoing in the vault of his skull, a final, fading stitch in the fabric of the world he had left behind.

# Chapter 9

## **Chapter 9**

The road to Mainz was not a road at all, but a long, slow wound in the earth. It was the memory of passage, a scar of mud and churned stone stitching through fields that were too green, too lush, after the grey clarity of his flight. The rain here was different from Cologne’s greasy insistence; it was a soft, forgetful drizzle that blurred the edges of things without ever cleaning them. It turned the world into a watercolour of brown and grey, the ink of the distant river a smudged line to his left. Tilman walked. His body was a hollow bell, still ringing with the impact that was not sound, but a cessation—the axe-strike, the severing. The key was a cold tooth against his sternum. A tool. He was a tool. The thought had the flat, finished quality of a smoothed plank, no grain left to wonder at.

He had crossed the threshold back into the ordinary world, but it was an ordinary world seen through glass, warped and distant. The spiritual seeking was over. Korbinian had sealed that with a sacrifice that was not a gift, but a transaction. Tilman carried the price. He was the receipt. The path was clear, and its very clarity was a new kind of prison.

Ahead, the track dipped into a shallow valley where a hamlet clung to the banks of a stream—a handful of wattle-and-daub huts, their thatch black with damp, and a low stone building that might have been an inn or a byre. Smoke, thin and defeated, bled from a hole in one roof. It was a place that seemed to exhale weariness. The ordinary world. Its threshold.

A man was digging in a strip of garden beside the nearest hut, his movements slow as a tide. He straightened as Tilman approached, leaning on his spade. His face was a map of sun and wind, his eyes the colour of old clay.

“Traveler,” the man said, not a greeting but an identification, like naming a species of bird.

Tilman nodded. His voice felt rusted shut. “Mainz?”

“A day. Less, if your business is urgent.” The man’s gaze was a physical weight, taking in Tilman’s sodden cloak, the empty scabbard at his belt, the hollows under his eyes. “Yours looks urgent. The kind that leaves a man light.”

“I travel light,” Tilman said, the words ash in his mouth.

“Do you.” The man pointed the tip of his spade south, past the hamlet. “The track forks by the mill-stone. Left follows the river, good footing. Right cuts through the Bingen wood. Shorter. Darker. Things fall apart in there. Paths, wheels, minds.” He studied Tilman again. “A man carrying urgent business might choose the wood. Think he can outrun the dark.”

“And can he?”

The man’s smile was a crack in dry earth. “The dark isn’t behind you, traveler. It’s the thing you carry. The wood just holds up a mirror.” He bent back to his digging, the conversation clearly ended. “Choose your mirror.”

Tilman walked through the hamlet. Faces watched from doorways, not with hostility, but with a blank, animal recognition. He was a weather, passing through. He felt the truth of the digger’s words. The solitude was not around him, but within. It was the purified state of his being now: a vessel for a key, a map for a ruin. The final test was not some monster in the wood. It was the acceptance of this emptiness. Could he bear the clarity of being merely a tool? Or would the last, stubborn splinter of the carpenter’s son—the part that wondered what to *build*—try to rebel, to make meaning from the directive?

He came to the fork. The left-hand path was wide, rutted by cart-wheels, following the river’s curve. The right-hand path was a mouth. It dove into a stand of ancient oak and beech, the canopy so thick the drizzle became a mere dripping memory of rain. The light beneath was green and submarine. The Bingen wood.

He stood for a long moment, the digger’s words echoing. *Choose your mirror.*
The river path was the world. The wood was the wound. He had just fled a forest of wounds. To choose another was madness. But the clarity upon him was a cold lens. The spiritual seeking was over. This was not about seeking, but about being found. The wood was not a distraction; it was a distillation. A final test of the transformed self.

He took the right-hand path.

***

The silence of the Bingen wood was not an absence, but a presence. It was the silence of held breath, of watchfulness. The drizzle did not reach the floor, only a perpetual, cold exhalation from the moss and the rotting leaves. The path, barely a scar, weaved between great, ribbed roots and tumuli of fern. The light lost all time of day, existing in a perpetual, green twilight.

Tilman walked. His breath plumed in the chill. The key was a dull, cold weight. He listened for the whisper of the forest, for the psychic bleed Korbinian had taught him to sense, but there was nothing. Only the drip, drip from the leaves, and the soft crush of his own boots on wet loam. This was not a place of spiritual seeking. It was a place of spiritual starvation. It mirrored the hollow in his chest perfectly.

He had walked perhaps an hour when he saw the first thread.

It was a filament of dirty gold, no thicker than a hair, caught on a thorny branch at eye-level. It glinted dully in the green gloom. Tilman stopped. He knew that thread. It was the same material as the cord around Korbinian’s wrist, the same substance Valerius had sought to prune from the world’s tapestry. A cut thread, somehow here, miles from the bridge.

He reached a hand, but did not touch it. As he watched, it trembled, then went slack, dissolving into motes of faint light that faded to nothing. A ghost of a severance.

A dozen steps later, he saw another, tangled in a spider’web. Then another, caught on bark. They were all fading, dying. They were not signs of the wound, but of its aftermath. The pruning had been precise, local. These were… echoes. Cast-offs. The psychic lint from Valerius’s work.

A cold different from the damp seeped into Tilman’s bones. He was not just walking towards Mainz. He was walking through the trailing edges of the instrument’s attention. It had been here. Or it was near.

The path began to slope downwards, into a deeper bowl of land where the trees grew thicker, their trunks swollen and twisted. The air grew colder. And then he saw the tree.

It was an oak, but it was wrong. It stood in a small clearing, its vast trunk split down the middle as if by a lightning strike. But the split was too clean, too straight. And from the wound, from the heartwood of the tree, threads spilled. Not a few fading filaments, but a cascade, a waterfall of silent, shimmering gold, pouring out from the oak’s core and pooling, glowing faintly, on the mossy ground. It was beautiful, and utterly profane. A tree, turned into a fountain of severed connections.

This was no echo. This was a fresh cut. A deliberate act.

Standing before the tree, his back to Tilman, was a figure in a grey, travel-stained robe. He was tall, gaunt. His head was shaved. In his right hand, he held not an axe, but a long, slender tool—a bodkin, its needle-like point glinting. With a surgeon’s precision, he reached into the cascade of threads and, finding one that glowed slightly brighter, he pinched it between his thumb and forefinger. He did not pull. He simply touched the point of the bodkin to it.

The thread vanished. Not cut, not severed. *Unmade.* It ceased to be, with a soft, soundless pop of negation. The light around the tree flickered.

Valerius.

Tilman’s breath froze in his lungs. The central antagonist was not in some distant fortress. He was here, in this mirrored wood, performing his final, meticulous work. This was not the chaotic, hungry attack of the forest wounds. This was the ultimate power: not just destruction, but erasure. The simplification of a complex world into nothingness. One thread at a time.

Valerius spoke, his voice dry and papery, not turning. “You feel it, don’t you? The lightness. The cleanliness. Each one is a story that will never be told. A pain that will never be felt. A love that will never go wrong. I am not a destroyer, carpenter’s son. I am a librarian, burning the dangerous books.”

Tilman found his voice. It was rough, unfamiliar. “You’re pruning the world to a stump.”

Finally, Valerius turned. His face was long, ascetic, his eyes the pale grey of a winter dawn. There was no madness in them, only a terrible, serene conviction. “To its essential shape. The shape it was meant to be before life… *complicated* it. Your friend understood complication. He was a knot. I untied him.” He gestured with the bodkin towards the weeping tree. “This was a nexus. A place where many paths crossed. Now it is simple. Quiet.”

“Korbinian was a man,” Tilman said, the cold in him hardening into a edge.

“He was a thread,” Valerius corrected. “A vibrant, troublesome one. Connected to you. To the key. To the old wound of Mainz. I could not reach the key. It is… shielded by older complicities. But I could cut the thread that led to it. I did.” He tilted his head. “And yet you are here. The key is here. The connection persists. A mystery.” His pale eyes scanned Tilman up and down. “Ah. I see. You are not holding the key. You have *become* it. You internalized the connection. How… messy. The carpenter’s son seeks to become a thing built, rather than a builder. A final, flawed complication.”

This was the desperate, final attempt. Not with armies, not with monsters. With truth. With the unveiling of Tilman’s own transformed, and pitiable, state. Valerius sought to defeat him by affirming his own conclusion: that he was merely a tool, an object. That his transformation was a pathetic surrender.

“You have achieved the solitude I seek for all things,” Valerius continued, taking a step forward. The bodkin pointed at Tilman’s heart. “You are admirably empty. Let me complete the work. Let me unmake the final connection—the one that binds the key to the vessel. You will be free. Truly free. A quiet, simple piece of the world.”

The offer hung in the damp air. It was seductive. To let go of the weight, the responsibility, the echoing loneliness. To have the relentless clarity resolved into nothingness. Tilman felt the pull of it, the spiritual seeking’s end in total annihilation. It would be so easy.

He saw Korbinian, not as he died, but as he lived—a man of infinite, frayed connections, of laughter and rage and deep, wounded love for a broken world. A knot. A complication. He saw his own hands, not empty, but remembered the feel of wood grain, the potential in a raw plank. The carpenter’s son did not just break. He also joined. He fitted. He made whole.

The clarity shifted. It was not the clarity of a tool, but of a choice.

He was not empty. He was full—of a sacrifice he did not ask for, of a key he did not understand, of a path he did not desire. But they were his. They were the complications of his being. To let Valerius unmade them was not victory, but the ultimate defeat. It was the rejection of his own, hard-won, terrible self.

“No,” Tilman said. The word was not loud, but it fell into the clearing like a stone into a still pool.

Valerius’s serene face showed the faintest fissure of disappointment. “Then you choose the pain. The mess. Very well. I will not just cut you.” He raised the bodkin. “I will unmake the space you occupy.”

Valerius moved. He was not fast, but his movement had the inevitability of a falling tree. The bodkin did not thrust; it *described* a line in the air towards Tilman. Where it passed, the world frayed. The green light tore. The sound of dripping leaves silenced. It was a line of nullity, coming to erase him.

Tilman did not have a weapon. He had nothing but what he had learned. He had learned to see the threads. He had learned that some connections are worth dying for. And he had learned, from Korbinian’s final act, that sometimes the only way to save the tapestry is to become a sacrifice so bright it blinds the shears.

He did not dodge the line of nullity. He stepped into it.

But he did not step as a man trying to be erased. He stepped as a key seeking its lock. He focused not on his own self, but on the connection within him—the cold, hard truth of the key against his skin, and the vast, silent pull of the wound it was made to address. Mainz. He threw his awareness down that connection, not seeking, but *asserting*. He was not Tilman running from an erasure. He was the road to Mainz. He was the map of the ruin. He was the complication that would not be simplified.

The bodkin’s line touched his chest.

There was no impact. There was a shriek of wrongness, a sound like tearing metal and breaking glass. The key under his tunic flared with a cold, blue light—not a spiritual light, but the light of old, forged iron, of physical law and sealed promise. The nullity met not a thread to be unmade, but a covenant. A thing already made, and finished.

Valerius’s eyes widened. The serene certainty shattered. “It is… a *literal* key?”

The bodkin vibrated in his hand, then cracked, a hairline fracture running up its needle-point. The backlash was silent and invisible, but Valerius staggered as if struck in the soul. The cascade of threads from the wounded oak flared violently, then snapped back into the tree with a thunderclap of returning energy. The oak shuddered, and with a groan of ancient wood, the clean split in its trunk began to knit. Not heal—knit, with ragged seams of bark and glowing sap, a brutal, complicated scar.

Valerius stared at his broken instrument, then at Tilman, who stood amidst the fading blue glow. The librarian’s face was a mask of pure, uncomprehending horror. He had tried to unmake a metaphor and found a thing. He had tried to prune a spiritual complication and been broken by a physical fact.

“You…” Valerius whispered. “You are not a thread. You are a *nail*.”

Tilman took a step forward. He felt no triumph, only a vast, weary certainty. “I am the carpenter’s son. And I am going to Mainz. You can’t unmake a door that’s already open.”

Valerius did not attack again. The fight had gone out of him. His ultimate power had failed against the sheer, stubborn *thereness* of Tilman’s purpose. He was a pruner of ethereal connections, and Tilman had become something else: a fixed point, a destination. He backed away, his grey robe blending with the mist between the trees, his pale eyes burning with a new, frustrated light. “Mainz will finish what I could not,” he hissed, a last thread of threat. “The wound does not need pruning. It consumes. It will simplify you to your bones.” Then he was gone, dissolved into the green gloom.

Tilman stood alone in the clearing. The oak stood before him, scarred but whole, a testament to brutal repair. The air no longer felt watchful, just tired. The mirror had been chosen, and he had not liked what he saw, but he had not broken. He had been used, and had used that very used-ness as a shield. He had achieved a final, decisive victory not by fighting the antagonist’s power, but by being the one thing that power could not comprehend: a simple, physical fact on a spiritual road.

He touched the key. It was warm now, humming with a faint, residual energy. A tool. He was a tool. But a tool has a purpose, and a user. He was the key, and he was also the hand that would turn it. The duality was no longer a conflict. It was the mechanism.

He turned and walked out of the Bingen wood. When he broke from the trees, the ordinary drizzle felt like a baptism. The world was still brown and grey, the road still a wound. But he was not the same man who had entered. The ghost of the axe-strike was gone from his skull, replaced by the clean, hard memory of the bodkin’s breaking. The spiritual seeking had ended in the forest. It had been reborn here, on this threshold, into something else: not seeking, but *resolve*. Not communion, but commitment.

He was cleansed of his old flaw—the belief that he had to be either the builder or the broken. He was both. He was the nail and the hammer. He was the map and the traveler. He was Tilman, the carpenter’s son, and he was going to Mainz.

The road curved ahead, following the river. In the distance, through the veil of rain, he could see the first, faint smudge of smoke on the horizon. Not a hamlet’s thin thread, but a great, spreading stain. A city.

Mainz.

The key pulsed once, a single, deep throb like a heartbeat, and fell silent. The hook was set. The door waited. And walking towards it, his solitude now a garment he wore by choice, Tilman felt the first, cold drop of a new kind of rain begin to fall.

# Chapter 10

## **Chapter 10**

The rain in Mainz was different. It did not settle like the greasy pall of Cologne, nor did it fall with the weary, cleansing drizzle of the Rhineland woods. It came in slanting, wind-whipped volleys, sharp and cold as flung nails, stinging the face and sheeting off the steep, slate roofs of the city in furious, grey torrents. It was a rain that spoke of industry, of waterwheels churning and forges hissing, a rain that seemed less a weather than a consequence of the great, smoking beast Tilman now approached.

He came not as a pilgrim, but as a fact. The solitude he wore was no longer the desperate cloak of the outcast, but the close-fitting tunic of a man who carried his own dimensions within him. The road had been a blade, and it had pared him down to something essential: a tool with a known purpose. The key against his chest was inert, a simple, cool weight of iron. Its work was not to pulse or hum, but to wait. His work was to arrive.

The city gates were not the picturesque, timber-framed archways of lesser towns. They were a fortress in miniature, a grim jaw of rust-coloured stone, teeth of iron portcullis raised but ready to drop. The guards wore the livery of the Archbishop—not sleepy local boys, but men with the flat, assessing eyes of professional soldiers. Their gazes scraped over Tilman as he joined the queue of carts and travellers: over his worn boots, his stained cloak, the humble, empty cart he pushed. He was mud and endurance. They saw nothing to tax, and less to fear. One jerked a thumb, a wordless command to pass, and Tilman entered the belly of the beast.

The noise was the first assault. It was a physical thing, a wall of sound that replaced the wind’s howl with the shriek of saws on stone, the thunder of hammers, the cacophonous din of a hundred trades shouted over a hundred more. The smell followed—a complex, overwhelming stench of wood-smoke and tanning vats, of sewage channelled into open gutters and the dense, yeasty breath of a thousand ovens. And beneath it all, the river-smell, the old, brown smell of the Rhine, but here it was curdled with offal and dye and the hot, metallic tang of the mint.

Tilman did not gawk. He moved with the slow, inevitable current of the crowd, his eyes recording without absorbing. This was not his world. His world was grain and joinery, the quiet logic of a well-cut mortise. This was a world of alchemy and ambition, where value was struck from blanks of silver and pressed onto discs of promise. He was a carpenter’s son walking into a city of coiners.

Yet, he felt no dislocation. The spiritual seeking had ended in the green gloom of the Bingen wood. What moved him now was a colder, clearer current: resolve. He was the map and the traveller. He had come to find the door for his key.

***

**Scene 1**

His people were not here. There was no community of carpenters to return to, no father’s workshop smelling of pine resin and regret. His ordinary world had been the road itself, and it had changed in his absence by becoming familiar. The only touchstone he had was a name, spoken once by a river-man in a haze of beer and superstition: *Gutenberg*.

Finding him was not a matter of asking. To ask was to invite attention, and attention was a currency he could not afford. Instead, Tilman became a student of the city’s anatomy. He took a corner of a crowded loft near the leather-workers’ yard, paying a week’s coin from his dwindling purse for the right to sleep on straw that crackled with other men’s fleas. By day, he pushed his cart through the labyrinth, offering himself for the meanest labour—unloading timber baulks at the yards by the river, hauling sacks of charcoal for the smiths. He listened. He learned the city’s dialects: the guttural patois of the foundrymen, the clipped, technical Latin of the clerics from the cathedral close, the singing, conspiratorial Yiddish of the Jews in their quarter.

He learned that the man named Gutenberg was not a myth. He was a citizen of some standing, yet edged with notoriety. A man of *the great work*. Some called him a visionary; others, a fool who had squandered a fortune from the Strasbourg venture on a madness of mirrors and presses and metal. He kept a workshop in a large stone house near the Kornmarkt, but it was a fortress as sure as the city gate. The men who came and went were tight-lipped, their hands stained not with ink, but with the peculiar, greasy black of the metal-casters.

Tilman watched the house for three days from the shadowed doorway of a baker’s opposite. He saw apprentices scurrying with wrapped parcels, saw a grim-faced financier—Fust, the gossip named him—arrive and leave with a face like thunder. He saw the dance of capital and desperation. It was a familiar dance. It was the dance of any man trying to force a vision into the stubborn, physical world.

On the fourth day, the opportunity presented itself not as a door opening, but as a load needing to be moved. A delivery of pre-cut oak planks, for presses or for frames, arrived on a wagon too wide for the alley beside Gutenberg’s house. The carter and his boy were arguing with a thick-set journeyman in a leather apron, their voices rising over the clatter of a coppersmith’s shop next door.

“I’m not hauling it round by the *Hintergasse*, that’ll take an hour! You said unload here!”

“And here is where it must be, you idiot! Through *that* door! Can you shrink the wagon, eh? Can you shrink the wood?”

Tilman set down the handles of his own cart. He walked over, not to the arguing men, but to the stacked timber. He ran a hand along the edge of a plank, his carpenter’s eye measuring its run, its knots. He looked at the journeyman, then at the narrow door.

“You need it inside?” he asked, his voice flat, cutting through the quarrel.

The journeyman, a man with forearms like cured hams and a permanent squint, glared at him. “What’s it to you?”

“A load is a load. I have a cart.” Tilman gestured to his own, empty but for its ropes. “Two-wheeled. It will fit the alley. We transfer the planks, I take them to your door. You pay me for the cart and the labour.”

The carter, seeing his problem solved, began nodding vigorously. The journeyman’s squint deepened as he assessed Tilman—the competent hands, the quiet certainty. This was not a beggar. This was a tool.

“How much?”

Tilman named a price that was fair, neither cheap enough to be suspect nor high enough to barter over. The journeyman spat on the cobbles. “Do it. And be quick. The Master doesn’t like clutter at his threshold.”

The transfer was the work of twenty minutes, a silent, efficient ballet of leverage and balance. Tilman felt the man’s eyes on him as he worked, noting the way he stacked the planks to keep them from warping, the sure knots he tied. When the last plank was loaded onto the smaller cart, the journeyman grunted.

“You’ve done this before.”

“I am a carpenter’s son.”

“A carpenter.” The man said the word as if it were a lesser species of the genus *worker*. “Well, come on then. And touch nothing inside but what you’re told to touch.”

The alley was a dank cleft, smelling of wet stone and old urine. The door at the end was reinforced with iron bands. The journeyman unlocked it with a key from a heavy ring at his belt and shoved it open.

The smell that rolled out was unlike anything Tilman had ever encountered. It was a temple-smell, but a temple to a new, metallic god. The acrid bite of vinegar and urine (for cleaning metal), the deep, resinous perfume of boiled linseed oil, the sooty scent of lamps burning late, and beneath it all, the hot, animal smell of men and sweat and concentrated purpose. The noise from the street fell away, replaced by the rhythmic, solid *thump* of a press in operation, the sizzle of metal being quenched, and a low, constant, busy murmur.

The workshop was a long, high-ceilinged hall, lit by a bank of tall, leaded windows grimed with the city’s smoke. It was chaos made functional. In one corner, a furnace glowed, tended by a soot-blackened man who stirred a crucible with a long rod. In another, a massive wooden press, a beast of screw and lever, stood with a great plate of inked metal poised beneath its blank, waiting page. Benches were littered with tiny, precise tools: punches, files, gravers. And everywhere, on racks, on trays, on sheets of parchment, were the letters.

Tilman’s breath caught. Not sheets of text, but thousands upon thousands of individual characters, cast in metal. A’s and E’s and B’s, in lines of pristine, identical soldiers. It was a forest of alphabets, a harvest of words disassembled into their component parts. The spiritual seeking in him, which he thought had been reborn into resolve, stirred at the sight. This was not communion with God’s word; this was its *reproduction*. Its democratization. It was a spiritual seeking enacted through machinery.

“Stop gawping. Against that wall, there. Stack it neat.”

Tilman obeyed, unloading the planks with a care that was now automatic. As he worked, he let his gaze travel. He saw the men—the compositors standing at their cases, selecting letters with swift, practised fingers, locking them into forms with a soft click of metal on metal. He saw the inker, a man with forearms dyed a permanent, shiny black, rolling his leather balls over the form with a gentle, loving pressure. He saw the printer, a giant of a man, throw his weight onto the great lever of the press, the wood groaning, the screw turning with a profound, final *thunk*.

And then he saw *him*. At the far end of the hall, standing before a desk strewn with diagrams and samples of parchment, was Johann Gutenberg.

He was not a tall man, but he carried a density of will that seemed to bend the space around him. His hair and beard were iron-grey, his face lined not with age but with concentration, a permanent furrow etched between his brows. He wore a merchant’s good wool, but it was stained at the cuffs with ink and acid. He was holding a single metal letter up to the grey light from the window, turning it, his lips moving silently. He was not looking at the shape of the letter, Tilman realized. He was looking at the space around it. The negative. The *not-letter* that would define it on the page.

This was the man. The door. The user of the tool.

Tilman finished stacking. The journeyman, whose name was Rike, counted out the coins into his palm. “You know your wood. If we need hauling again, I’ll look for you at the yards.”

It was a dismissal. Tilman pocketed the coins, his hand brushing the key through his tunic. He had seen the community. It had changed in his absence from a vague idea into a noisy, smelly, glorious reality. He was outside it, looking in. He turned to go.

“You.”

The voice was not loud, but it cut through the workshop’s din like a graver through soft lead. Gutenberg had lowered the letter and was looking directly at him.

Tilman turned. “Meister?”

Gutenberg walked over, his steps quick, precise. He ignored Tilman, circling the stack of planks. He ran a finger along the edge of the topmost one, then crouched, peering at the grain. He stood, his sharp eyes now on Tilman’s face.

“This was cut green. Seasoned too fast near a kiln. See the tension here?” He pointed to an almost invisible hairline crack. “It will warp before the year is out. Did you not see it?”

Tilman met his gaze. “I saw it.”

“And you accepted it?”

“The load was not mine to accept or refuse. It was mine to move. You paid for the wood, not my opinion of it.”

A flicker in Gutenberg’s eyes—not anger, but interest. “A practical man. Rike says you are a carpenter’s son.”

“I was.”

“Was. What are you now?”

Tilman felt the eyes of the workshop upon him. The *thump* of the press had stopped. The sizzle of the metal had paused. He was being assessed by the whole organism. He thought of the bodkin breaking against the key. He thought of being a fact.

“I am a man who understands that a thing must be fit for its purpose,” he said. “That wood is not. But it will serve for a temporary frame, if you brace it diagonally. It should not bear a load.”

Gutenberg stared at him for a long moment. The silence stretched, filled only by the drip of condensation from a roof beam. Then he gave a short, sharp nod. “Rike. Have it braced as he says.” He turned back to his desk, then paused, looking over his shoulder. “You. What is your name?”

“Tilman.”

“Tilman. There is a broken tympan on the smaller press. The hinge is wood. It needs to be remade, in hardwood, and fitted true. Can you do that?”

It was not an invitation. It was a test thrown down like a gauntlet.

“I can,” Tilman said.

“Then do it. Rike will show you. You will be paid by the piece.” He turned away, already absorbed again in the letter in his hand.

Tilman did not smile. He felt no triumph. He felt the clean, hard click of a joint settling into its socket. He had returned to a community that did not know it needed him. He had passed through its gate not with a story, but with a silent competence. The ordinary world had not changed in his absence. He had arrived to change it.

***

**Scene 2**

The elixir he had gained in the forest was not a potion to share, nor a wisdom to proclaim. It was a state of being: the integration of builder and broken, of nail and hammer. He shared it not through words, but through the work of his hands.

The broken tympan was a sorry thing—a frame meant to hold the paper flat against the form, its oak hinge chewed to splinters by the relentless pressure of the screw. Rike dumped it on a clear bench in a quieter corner, along with a block of dense, close-grained beech.

“Master says you’re to have this. Tools are there. Don’t waste it.” His tone suggested he fully expected Tilman to waste it.

Tilman ignored him. He ran his palms over the beech, feeling its spirit, its willingness. He examined the shattered hinge, not just the break, but the stress patterns, the points of failure. He did not simply see a broken piece; he saw the history of its breaking, and the future of its repair. This was the elixir: perception without judgement. Problem without drama.

He selected a saw, a chisel, a mallet from the workshop’s racks. They were good tools, cared for. He sharpened the chisel on an oilstone until its edge vanished into a line of pure light. Then he began.

He worked not with speed, but with a profound, unhurried certainty. The *snick* of the chisel paring a shaving, the clean whisper of the saw, the soft tap of the mallet driving a joint home—these were the only sounds from his corner. He did not look up. He became a locus of quiet within the workshop’s storm.

One by one, the men began to notice. The inker, wiping his balls, paused to watch the long, curling shavings fall. A compositor, taking a moment to rest his eyes, let his gaze linger on the emerging, elegant shape of the new hinge—not a copy of the old, but an improvement, with a deeper socket and a broader bearing surface. It was a piece of humble, perfect logic.

Rike came over twice, his scepticism hardening into a grudging silence. Tilman asked for nothing. He needed no instruction. He was the map and the traveller, and the map was inscribed in the wood itself.

When the hinge was carved, he fitted it to the tympan frame. It required no forcing. It slid into place with a soft, final sigh. He pegged it, not with nails that could work loose, but with dowels of seasoned ash, glued and wedged. He set the reassembled tympan aside for the glue to cure and began cleaning his tools.

It was then that Peter Schöffer, the young foreman of the compositors—a man with the delicate hands of a scribe and the impatient mind of an engineer—approached. He had been watching the longest, his intelligent eyes missing nothing.

“That was well done,” Schöffer said, his voice quiet. He picked up the tympan, testing the hinge’s swing. It moved smoothly, without play. “You understand that the pressure is not straight down. It is a twist, here, at the fulcrum. You compensated for it.”

Tilman nodded. “The wood told me.”

Schöffer’s eyebrow raised. A mystical statement, but delivered with the flat tone of a physical fact. He set the tympan down. “The Master has a problem. The chase for the Psalter pages—the iron frame that holds the form. It is not holding true. Under pressure, it bows, ever so slightly. The type rocks. The impression is fuzzy. We have tried thicker metal. It still bows. The men say it is a flaw in the casting, a spirit in the iron.” He said this last with a hint of contempt. “Can a carpenter’s son reason with a spirit in iron?”

Tilman looked past him, to the great press where the massive chase, a rectangle of black iron, lay disassembled. He saw the problem not as a spiritual flaw, but as a physical one. A frame under uniform pressure will bow at its weakest point. The solution was not to fight the pressure, but to redirect it. To accept the bow and make it part of the structure.

“It needs a cross-brace,” Tilman said. “Not to resist the bow, but to convert it into tension. A bar here,” he pointed to the air, sketching, “fixed not rigidly, but with a joint that allows movement in one plane only. It would become part of the press, not a prisoner of it.”

Schöffer stared at him, his mind working visibly. Then, without a word, he turned and walked to Gutenberg’s desk. He spoke quickly, in a low voice, gesturing towards Tilman. Gutenberg looked up, his gaze sharp. He rose and strode over, Schöffer in his wake.

“Explain,” Gutenberg commanded, pointing at the chase.

Tilman did. He used no technical terms the men wouldn’t know. He spoke of load, of weakness, of stealing strength from the force itself. He was not sharing wisdom from a journey; he was sharing the architecture of his own transformed mind—a mind that saw conflict as a potential for mechanics.

Gutenberg listened, his eyes fixed on the iron frame. When Tilman finished, the Master was silent for a full minute. The workshop held its breath.

“Make it,” Gutenberg said finally. “In wood first. A model. Show me.”

It was not praise. It was a greater trust. Tilman had shared his elixir—the hard-won understanding of integration—and it had been understood, not as philosophy, but as utility. The healing he offered was for the press, and by extension, for the great work itself. The community, this brotherhood of ink and metal, had taken its first sip.

***

**Scene 3**

Recognition in the workshop of Gutenberg was not ceremony. It was a shift in the quality of silence when you entered a room. It was the cessation of side-long glances, replaced by direct, appraising looks. It was Rike, two days later, grunting “The model’s on the Master’s desk,” as if Tilman should know where that was.

The wooden model of the cross-brace, with its clever, constrained joint, sat amidst Gutenberg’s papers. The Master was there, with Schöffer and the grim financier, Fust. They were arguing about costs, about deadlines, about the purity of antimony in the type-metal. Gutenberg’s face was thunderous. He saw Tilman and broke off, stabbing a finger at the model.

“This. Can it be forged in iron? By next week?”

Tilman considered. “Forged, yes. But the joint would be weaker. It would be better cast. As one piece with the chase. A new casting.”

Fust swore. “A new casting! The cost, Johann! The time!”

“The time we lose now re-printing every spoiled sheet is greater!” Gutenberg shot back. He looked at Tilman. “You are certain?”

“The strength is in the unity of the piece,” Tilman said, the words echoing in his own soul. “A joint is a weakness pretending to be a strength. For this, it must be whole.”

Gutenberg held his gaze. In that moment, Tilman saw the man’s terrible burden: the vision forever trapped in the intractable flesh of the world, in the petty tyranny of metal and coin. He saw a spiritual seeker of a different kind, one who sought to replicate the divine word through a symphony of mechanics and debt. He saw a user of tools, desperate for the right one.

“You will oversee it,” Gutenberg decided, cutting through Fust’s next protest. “With Konrad, at the foundry. You speak the language of the thing. See it done.”

It was a staggering elevation. From hauling timber to overseeing a crucial casting in a matter of days. Schöffer looked surprised, then thoughtful. Rike looked as if he’d swallowed a fly. Fust looked furious.

But the recognition was complete. Tilman had found his new place. He was not a compositor, nor an inker, nor a printer. He was the *bridge*. The man who could translate the ideal geometry of the page into the stubborn physics of wood and iron. He was the embodied understanding that the spiritual and the material were not warring kingdoms, but the two faces of a single, functional truth. He was the key, and he was also the hand. And now, he had been given a lock to study.

His days became a rhythm of charcoal sketches on parchment, of heated discussions with the foundry-men in their soot-choked yard, of returning to the workshop with the smell of fire on his clothes. He ate with the men at the long table, listening to their talk of punches and matrices, of the endless quest for the perfect, uniform ink. He said little. He observed. He was both inside and outside, a part of the organism but performing a unique, newly-evolved function.

One evening, as a late, grey light bled through the high windows, Gutenberg came to his bench. Tilman was refining the drawing for the new chase, his line sure and clean.

“You do not ask about the work,” Gutenberg said, not a question.

“I see the work,” Tilman replied, not looking up.

“What do you see?”

Tilman set down his charcoal. He looked at the press, at the cases of type, at the sheets of vellum hanging like ghosts. “I see a machine for thinking. A way to make a thought as solid and as multiple as a coin. You are not printing books, Meister. You are minting minds.”

Gutenberg was very still. The noise of the workshop seemed to recede. For a moment, the relentless, practical tyrant was gone, and in his place was just the seeker, naked in his ambition. “Yes,” he said, the word almost a sigh. “And like any mint, it consumes capital faster than it produces product. Fust breathes down my neck for salvation or for blood.” He focused on Tilman, his intensity returning. “The chase. It must work. You understand? It is not one piece of iron. It is the linchpin.”

“I understand,” Tilman said. And he did. He was no longer just a carpenter fixing a press. He was a man helping to build the engine of a revolution. The recognition was not of his worth to them, but of his understanding of their worth. He had found his place not in the world, but in the crack between two worlds—the old world of script and spirit, and the new world of mechanics and mass. He was the living hinge between them.

***

**Scene 4**

The new chase, cast in one piece with its integral cross-brace, arrived on a damp Thursday morning. It was black, heavy, and utterly without ornament—a thing of pure, brutal function. The men gathered around as it was bolted to the press. The form for a page of the Psalter was locked into it, the tiny metal letters a city of inverted words. The inker rolled his black balls over it. The blank sheet of precious vellum was laid on the tympan—Tilman’s tympan, with its silent, perfect hinge. The frisket was folded. The bed was rolled under the great screw.

The printer, Hans, spat on his hands and took the lever. He threw his weight.

The screw turned with its usual groan. The platen descended. But there was a new sound—a deep, solid, unified *crunch*, like a great bone settling, instead of the faint, protesting shiver of before. Hans held the pressure, his muscles corded, then released. The screw rose. The bed rolled out.

Schöffer was there first. He and Gutenberg bent over the printed sheet as the frisket was peeled back. The silence was absolute. Then Schöffer let out a breath, a sound of pure reverence. He lifted the vellum.

The text was perfect. Black as a starless night, uniform, every serif sharp, every stem unwavering. No rocking. No fuzz. The great, bowed weakness had been transformed into a source of strength. The page was a masterpiece of clarity.

Gutenberg took the sheet. He held it to the light. He did not smile. His hand trembled, just once. He looked from the page to the new, ugly, beautiful chase, then to Tilman, who stood at the edge of the circle.

“*Es funktioniert*,” he said quietly. It works.

Those two words established the new balance. The ordinary world of the workshop was improved, saved from a crippling flaw. The great work could advance. The spiritual seeking of Gutenberg—to multiply the Word—was now yoked, more firmly than ever, to the physical genius of the machine. And Tilman was the man who had yoked it.

He was given a permanent space in the workshop, a bench of his own near the tools. His pay was increased. He was, for all intents and purposes, one of them. Yet the balance was delicate, new. He was an essential part, but he was not of their origin. He was a carpenter among metal-men, a quiet man among the driven. He was the key, waiting in the lock. The door was Gutenberg’s ambition, and it was opening.

That night, as Tilman lay in his loft above the leather-yard, the key against his chest felt warm again for the first time since Mainz. Not with a pulse, but with a steady, low heat, as if from a banked fire. He did not know what door it was meant for. The Psalter? The greater Bible he heard whispered of? Or something else entirely?

He thought of the perfect page, the mind minted into vellum. He thought of the power it represented. Not just spiritual power, but a terrible, worldly power. The power to shape what a thousand, ten thousand, a million minds would think. The Archbishop’s men were never far from the workshop. The Church would want this machine. Princes would want it. Whoever held this engine held a weapon far greater than any sword.

The hook was set deep within him now. He had found his community, his purpose. He had shared his elixir and been recognized. A new balance was established. But as he stared into the darkness, listening to the ceaseless, hungry rain of Mainz hammer the slates, Tilman understood the true nature of his transformation.

The spiritual seeking was over. He was now a soldier in a war he had not known was being fought. A war for the soul of the word itself. And the key around his neck was no longer just a tool for a door.

It was a weapon waiting for its moment to turn.

# Chapter 11

## **Chapter 11**

The rain in Mainz was a different creature than the rain in Cologne. It lacked Cologne’s greasy, clinging weight. Here, it was a percussive force, a drummer on the rooftops, hammering the slates of the leather-yard with a sound like a thousand impatient fingers. To Tilman, lying in his loft, it was no longer the sound of judgement or of loss. It was the sound of work suspended, of the great machine sleeping, of ink staying thick in its pots and freshly cast type resting, unassembled, in their cases. It was the sound of a pause in the war.

His days had acquired a new and solid rhythm, as precise as the reciprocating motion of the press itself. He rose in the grey pre-dawn, the key a familiar, cool weight against his sternum. He broke his fast with the others in the workshop’s cramped anteroom—coarse bread, a smear of lard, thin beer—and the talk was no longer of mysteries or of his strangeness. It was of alignment, of impression, of the stubbornness of a particular batch of linseed oil. He was asked for his opinion. “The frisket,” Peter would grunt, pushing a frayed parchment frame across the trestle. “The hinge binds. The carpenter’s eye.” And Tilman would examine it, his thick fingers probing the joint, feeling for the minute warp, the grain that fought the pin. He would take it to his bench, apply a plane so fine it produced curls of oak thinner than a fingernail, and return it. A nod was his thanks. It was a language he understood.

His bench was his kingdom. It stood near the forge and the casting stools, a island of ordered wood in a sea of metal shavings and soot. Here, he kept his own tools, each one laid out with a care that bordered on reverence. Here, he worked on the small things: a new mallet with a head of applewood, perfectly balanced for tapping formes into their coffins; a set of callipers for Fust to measure paper margins; a delicate, sprung clamp for holding a damaged page under repair. He was the fixer of the small failures, the preventer of the large ones. The machine, in its sprawling, clanking entirety, relied on the integrity of a hundred silent, wooden parts. He ensured that integrity.

One such afternoon, the rain having slackened to a drizzle, he was fitting a new handle to a chasing hammer for Hans. The workshop hummed with its wet-weather work: the rasp of files dressing type, the low murmur of Gutenberg and Fust in the counting-room, their voices a steady river of calculation and ambition under the door. The fire in the forge was banked, casting a dull, red glow that painted the men in shades of copper and shadow.

The street door opened, letting in a gust of damp air and a slice of pallid light. A figure stood silhouetted, hesitant. The workshop fell quiet, all but the file on metal. It was Konrad.

He looked thinner, his baker’s apron replaced by a patched tunic, his face pale beneath its usual flour-dust. His eyes scanned the chaotic, male space, flinching from the heat and the strange, metallic scent, until they found Tilman. There was no anger in his look. Only a deep, weary confusion.

Tilman set the hammer down. The *click* of wood on oak was loud in the silence. He wiped his hands on his apron and walked over, feeling the eyes of the men upon him—not hostile, but watchful. This was an intrusion from the world of bread and small beer, a world they had all, in their way, abandoned.

“Konrad,” Tilman said, stopping a few feet away.

“Tilman.” Konrad’s voice was hoarse. He glanced past him at the monstrous skeleton of the press, at the cases of gleaming type. “I… heard things. In the tavern. They say you are a master here. That you saved the work.”

“I fixed a flaw,” Tilman said, the workshop’s humility in his tone. “It was a joint. A bad joint.”

Konrad shook his head, as if the simplicity of the statement was the most baffling part. “They said it was magic. Or heresy. Or both.” He looked directly at Tilman then, his friend’s face pleading for sense. “You left. You left without a word. Marta… she weeps. She thinks you are damned, or dead, or both.”

The old guilt, the Cologne guilt, rose in Tilman’s throat. But it was a quieter thing now, tempered by the steady heat of the key and the certainty of his bench. He was not the same man who had fled that warm, yeast-scented kitchen.

“I am not damned,” Tilman said, and the words felt true. “And I am not dead. I am here.” He gestured around him, not with pride, but with a statement of fact. “This is my work.”

“But what *is* it?” Konrad’s whisper was fierce. “What work is worth the loss of friends? Worth the fear in your sister’s heart? It’s a machine. I see it. It makes marks on paper. Like a scribe, but louder and uglier.”

Tilman thought of the perfect page. He thought of the mind minted into vellum. How to explain the silent army being born in this room? How to describe the weapon to a man whose hands knew only the weight of dough, the warmth of an oven?

“A scribe writes one book,” Tilman said slowly, choosing each word like a type from its case. “This… will write the same book, a hundred times, a thousand times, all in the time it takes a scribe to sharpen his quill. The same words. Perfect. Unchanging.”

Konrad blinked. “Why? Who needs a hundred Bibles?”

“Who needs a hundred swords?” Tilman countered softly. “The man who has an army.”

The baker’s face went still as he grappled with the scale of it. The spiritual seeking—the multiplication of the Word—was a concept for priests. But an army? That was a thing of the world. He looked from the press to Tilman’s face, seeing the calm certainty there, the peace that had replaced the frantic hunger. It was this, more than any talk of machines or armies, that seemed to reach him.

“You are different,” Konrad murmured.

“I am,” Tilman admitted. “I have a place. It is here, in this noise and this smell and this ambition. It is not a better place than yours. But it is mine.”

He stepped closer then, out of earshot of the others. “Tell Marta I am well. Tell her I am not damned. Tell her I think of her, and of you, every day. But I cannot come back to knead dough. This…” He nodded back towards his bench, towards the press. “This is the dough I must knead.”

Konrad studied him for a long moment. He saw the carpenter’s strong hands, stained now with ink and metal-dust. He saw the quiet purpose in his stance. He did not understand, but he recognized integrity when he saw it. The anger had bled out of him, leaving only a sad acceptance.

“She will want a sign,” Konrad said finally. “That you are still her brother. That you are still… you.”

Tilman thought. Then he walked to his bench, opened a small, locked chest beneath it—a chest that held his few personal things, and the vial of the last drops of his elixir. He took out a wooden token, a practice piece he had carved during his first, lonely days. It was a simple thing, a circle of beechwood, on one side a crude but recognizable loaf of bread, on the other, a single, cleanly struck letter: a ‘T’. He pressed it into Konrad’s flour-soft hand.

“Give her this. The bread is her. The letter is me. We are pressed together. Different, but on the same page.”

Konrad closed his fist around the token. He gave one last, bewildered look at the workshop, the alchemists of letters, then nodded at Tilman, a nod between men. He turned and left, the door closing on the drizzle, sealing the workshop back into its own world.

The sounds of filing resumed. Hans picked up the chasing hammer, testing the new handle. He gave Tilman a brief, approving glance. No one spoke of it. The reconciliation was a private thing, a small, human adjustment in the corner of the great endeavour. Tilman felt a knot within him, one he had carried since Cologne, loosen and fall away.

***

Days later, it was the boy, Leon, who sought him out. The youth had been given the most tedious of tasks: sorting the broken and damaged type, the “sort” from which the term came, into bins for re-melting. He worked in a corner, a picture of sullen misery, his quick fingers made clumsy by boredom.

Tilman watched him for a time from his bench. He saw the intelligence in the boy’s eyes, stifled by the monotony. He saw the way his gaze kept drifting to the press, to the dance of the men around it, hungry for the secret at the heart of the noise.

During a lull, Tilman went over. He said nothing, just pulled up a stool and began to help. He picked a piece of type from the pile, a lowercase ‘e’. He held it up to the dim light from the window.

“See here,” Tilman said, his voice low. “The stem is bent. It struck too hard, or the paper was too damp. It will print a flaw. A blur where there should be clarity.” He set it in the bin for lead. He picked up another. “This one… the face is worn. It has printed ten thousand words, perhaps. It is tired. Its impression is weak.” Into the bin it went.

Leon watched, his sullenness replaced by curiosity. “How can you tell? They all look the same.”

“They are not the same,” Tilman said. “No two are. The mould is perfect, but the casting is a living thing. The metal cools differently each time. There are breaths in it, tiny voids. A man must learn to see the individual in the multitude.” He found a good piece, a clean, sharp ‘o’. He handed it to the boy. “This one is sound. It is ready to speak again.”

Leon took it, turning it in his fingers, seeing it not as rubbish but as a soldier. “It seems a worthless job,” the boy muttered, but with less heat.

“Is the foundation of a cathedral worthless?” Tilman asked. “Before the first stone is laid, the ground must be made true. This,” he gestured to the piles of type, “is making the ground true. The Word cannot be built on sand. Or on flawed letters.” He met the boy’s eyes. “You are not sorting rubbish. You are curating an army. You are learning to see. Every man here has done this. Even Gutenberg.”

This last was a lie, or perhaps not; Tilman didn’t know. But it had the desired effect. Leon’s spine straightened. He looked at the bins with new respect. Tilman rose, leaving him to it. He did not look back, but he heard the boy’s sorting become more deliberate, less frantic. He was listening to the metal now, looking for its story. The mentorship was not in grand speeches, but in the dignity granted to a small task. It was the passing on of a lens, a way of seeing order in chaos.

***

The final peace came on a Sunday, when the workshop was still. The rain had ceased. A rare, anaemic sun fell through the high windows, cutting shafts through the floating dust. Tilman had come not to work, but simply to be.

He stood before the assembled press. It was silent, a beast at rest. The great screw rose like a tree trunk towards the beams. The platen, that mighty hammer of smooth oak, hung poised. The forme for the next page of the Psalter lay in its coffin, a rectangle of lead and antimony filled with a backwards, metallic poem. He ran his hand along the frame, feeling the grain, the perfect joints, the absolute solidity of it.

He was home.

Not in a place of warmth and yeast, but in a place of ink and potential. His spiritual seeking had ended not in a blinding light, but in the precise click of a well-made joint. The hunger that had driven him from Cologne was gone, replaced by the steady, satisfying work of maintenance, of ensuring that the great engine of ambition functioned. The key against his chest was quiet, a tool, not a talisman. He was the keeper of the mechanism. He was the man who ensured the door, once opened, would not sag on its hinges.

He walked to the proofing slab where a single sheet, pulled yesterday, lay pinned. It was the *Beatus vir* page. The letters were a forest of black, perfect and uniform, a geometry of devotion more regular than any scribe’s hand could achieve. He traced a finger over the ink, not quite touching the vellum. He felt the slight ridge of the impression, the kiss of the machine. It was power. It was a weapon. But in this silent moment, it was also merely beautiful.

A shadow fell across the sheet. Gutenberg stood beside him, his presence like a change in air pressure. The master said nothing for a long while, both of them contemplating the page.

“It is a beginning,” Gutenberg said finally, his voice a low rumble. “The Psalter is a test. A prelude.” He turned his fierce, calculating eyes on Tilman. “The Archbishop has seen proofs. He is… impressed. He speaks of a greater work. A full Bible. Not for his cathedral, but for Rome itself.”

Tilman felt the words settle in the quiet room. A Bible. The ultimate Word. The ultimate army.

“It will require more of everything,” Gutenberg continued. “More presses. More type. More paper. More men.” His gaze was speculative, weighing. “And more wood. More frames. More precision. The scale… it will be tenfold. A hundredfold.”

He placed a hand on the press, a possessive, almost loving gesture. “This war you feel, carpenter. It is real. The battle is for the mind of Christendom. And we are building the artillery.” He looked at Tilman, and for the first time, Tilman saw not just ambition, but a shared, grim understanding. “Can your craft hold? Can it scale?”

Tilman looked from the perfect page to the silent machine, to his own bench in the corner. He thought of the endless, tiny perfections required. The joints that must never fail. The frames that must never bow. The relentless, multiplying pressure of the idea.

The key against his chest did not grow warm. It felt, for the first time, cold. A cold, precise weight.

“It will have to,” Tilman said.

And in the stillness of the sunlit workshop, he heard the first, distant drumbeat of the coming siege.

# Chapter 12

## **Chapter 36**

The rain in Cologne had lost its weight. It fell now as a clean, autumnal veil, rinsing the soot from the sky and washing the cobbles of the Hohe Straße until they shone like dark pearls. It was not a settling, but a release. Tilman stood beneath the overhang of a printer’s shop—not Gutenberg’s, that chapter was closed—and watched the world soften and blur. He did not pull his cloak tight. The wool was good, dense and dry, woven by his own wife’s hands. He did not duck his head. He let the mist cool his face, a man no longer afraid of the judgement in windows, for he carried his own measure, and it was merciful.

He was not late. The light was gentle, leaching from a sky the colour of weathered ash, and he had come to this street, this city of his old ghosts, precisely at the appointed hour. Not because he was summoned, but because he had chosen to answer.

**Scene 1: The Echo in the Stone**

The Archbishop’s palace was quieter than he remembered. The bustle of ambition had moved on, following newer machines, newer men. The guard recognized him not as the harried carpenter of a decade past, but as the master craftsman whose name was whispered in connection with books that now rested in Rome, in Paris, in Vienna. He was led not to a scullery or a workshop, but to a sunlit chamber where the Archbishop, Johann von Wesel, sat by a window, a single, heavy volume on a lectern before him.

The man had aged. The fierce political fire in his eyes had banked to a steady, watchful warmth. He did not rise, but gestured to a chair.

“Tilman of Mainz. Or is it Strasbourg now?”

“For a time, Your Grace. The work moves where the river is clearest.”

The Archbishop nodded, his hand resting on the book. It was one of the Bibles. Not the first, frantic, beautiful Psalter, but the great, two-volume Gutenberg Bible. The Word made army. Its pages were pristine, but the leather of its cover was worn soft at the corners from use.

“I look at this,” the Archbishop said, his voice quiet, almost confessional. “I look at these perfect, regimented letters, and I remember the chaos of its birth. The debt, the secrecy, the fear, the betrayals. The sheer, blasphemous noise of those presses.” He traced a line of text with a finger. “And yet, here it sits. Silent. Imposing. It has begun to change everything, Tilman. Men read alone now, in silence, arguing with the text in their own heads, without a priest to guide them. It is the artillery your master spoke of. The siege is underway.”

Tilman felt the old key, no longer worn against his skin but kept in a small chest at home, grow cold in his memory. “Was it the war you wanted, Your Grace?”

The Archbishop looked out at the rain-rinsed cathedral spires. “I wanted the Word to be free. I did not understand that freedom is the most chaotic of states. This…” he tapped the Bible, “…this precision, it creates a new kind of authority. Not of the voice, but of the page. A different cage, perhaps.” He turned his gaze to Tilman. “You left before the final triumph. Why?”

The question had hung in the air for years. Tilman had answered it for his wife, for himself, in the quiet of their workshop in Strasbourg, where they built smaller, finer presses for scholars and poets. Now, he gave the true answer.

“The machine demanded a soul, Your Grace. Not just mine. Its own. It wanted everything to be like itself: uniform, replicable, perfect. I felt my own craft—the grain, the give, the imperfection that holds tension—becoming a sin against its logic. I was building the frame for a new world, and I saw no place in that frame for the thing that made me able to build it.”

He paused, the old spiritual seeking, once a desperate groping in the dark, now a calm current in his thoughts. “I sought God in the joint, in the hidden perfection that allows for movement. The press sought Him only in the immutable stamp. I could not worship at that altar.”

The Archbishop studied him for a long moment, then a slow smile touched his lips. “So the carpenter saved his soul by walking away from the greatest work of his age. There is a parable in that.” He pushed the heavy Bible aside, as if moving a monument. “I did not call you here to talk of the past. I called you because I have a new commission. Not from Rome. From me.”

He gestured to a small, plain box on the table. Inside, on a bed of velvet, lay a set of exquisitely carved wooden blocks. Tilman picked one up. It was a letter, but not for a press. It was a capital ‘A’, but within its form was carved a tiny, intricate forest—a tree, a bird, a fox hidden in the negative space. It was a thing of beauty meant to be printed once, to begin a manuscript, a bridge between the old art and the new.

“The Psalter for the common folk,” the Archbishop said. “Simple prayers. But I want it to be… a haven. Not an artillery piece. A garden. The text will be printed. But the illustrations, the capitals… I want them to bear the mark of a hand. Of a soul. I want the machine and the spirit to share the page, as they must share the world.”

Tilman felt a strange warmth, not in his chest, but in his hands. The old seeking found its object not in rejection, but in reconciliation. “You want a frame,” he said softly. “Not for the machine, but for the man who holds the book.”

“Yes,” said the Archbishop. “Can your craft hold that?”

Tilman looked from the carved block to the rain-cleansed sky outside. “It is the only craft I have.”

**Scene 2: The New Page**

The workshop in Mainz was not his own. It belonged to a young printer, Peter, a man of fervent eyes and ink-stained fingers who had broken from Gutenberg’s orbit to print pamphlets and broadsides. The air was familiar—the smell of lampblack, the tang of vinegar used to clean type, the woody scent of paper. But the rhythm was different, faster, looser.

Peter showed him the commission with reverent excitement. “The Archbishop’s ‘Garden of Prayers’. A humble thing. But the idea… to mix media! It is revolutionary!”

Tilman set up his bench in a corner, much like his old one. He unpacked his tools, each one an old friend. As he began to sketch the frames for the illustrated pages, Peter bustled over, holding a damp sheet.

“Look! News from the Diet of Nuremberg! Printed in a day and already here!” The sheet was crude, the type mismatched, the Latin uneven. It was a decree on trade tariffs. It was also, Tilman realized with a jolt, power. Not the monumental power of the Bible, but the swift, viral power of the moment. This was the true offspring of the press: not just the eternal Word, but the ephemeral shout.

Peter’s eyes gleamed. “This is the future, Master Tilman. Not big books for princes, but small words for everyone. Ideas can travel like the plague now.”

Tilman looked at the smudged, urgent sheet, then at the delicate frame taking shape under his pencil. Two futures. One shouted, one whispered. His spiritual seeking had always been for the whisper beneath the noise, the joint that held disparate things together. His new challenge, he saw, was not to build for scale, but to build for harmony. To make a space for the whisper in a world learning to shout.

“They will need each other,” Tilman said, more to himself than to Peter. “The shout to gather the crowd. The whisper to give them a reason to stay.”

He returned to his drawing, the lines flowing more surely now. He would build a frame that was both strong and gentle. A sanctuary on the page.

**Scene 3: The Joint That Holds**

The work took months. As Tilman carved the moulds for the decorative borders—vines that intertwined with the printed text, margins that blossomed with wooden flowers meant to be hand-illuminated—he found a peace deeper than any he had known in the frantic glory days.

One evening, as a similar soft rain pattered against the shutters, he was visited by an unexpected figure: Fust, Gutenberg’s former financier, now a successful printer in his own right. The man was richer, softer around the edges, but his eyes still held their calculating glint.

“Tilman. I heard you were back at a bench. I came to see if it was true.”

“It is true, Herr Fust.”

Fust walked around the workshop, inspecting the delicate woodblocks with a connoisseur’s eye. “Charming. A step backwards, some might say. A decorative footnote to history.”

“Perhaps,” Tilman said, unbothered. He was oiling a finished block, feeling the grain come alive under his touch.

“Gutenberg is in Eltville,” Fust said abruptly. “Broke. Bitter. Chasing a new scheme for polishing gems. The Bible made him immortal and ruined him. A paradox.”

Tilman felt a pang, not of guilt, but of a profound, sad understanding. The machine had consumed its maker. The seeker who wanted to replicate perfection had been shattered by its cost.

“He saw the light,” Tilman said quietly. “But he forgot that we see it through a prism. We can only ever work with the fragments.”

Fust looked at him curiously. “You speak like a theologian.”

“I am a carpenter. I only know that a thing must have give, or it breaks under pressure. Even the truth.”

Fust was silent for a long time. Then he nodded, once, a gesture of gruff respect. “This,” he said, pointing at the nearly completed ‘Garden of Prayers’ page on Tilman’s bench, “this will be a treasure. Not because it is powerful, but because it is whole.” He turned to leave, then paused. “He asked after you, once. Gutenberg. He said, ‘That one, he understood the pressure.’ I think he meant it as praise.”

After Fust left, Tilman sat in the gathering dusk. He thought of his journey: from the terrified apprentice running through greasy rain, to the essential artisan in a war of ideas, to the exile seeking his soul in simpler wood, to this—a man who could hold both the monumental and the miniature in his mind, and see the divine in the joint between them. His seeking had not ended in a blinding light, but in a clarified vision. He had sought God in the making, and found that the making itself was the prayer.

**Scene 4: The Open Frame**

The day the “Garden of Prayers” was completed, the rain had ceased. A pale, forgiving sun lit the Hohe Straße. Tilman stood outside Peter’s shop, the first printed and illuminated copy in his hands. The book was small, intimate. On the opening page, his wooden border—a frame of oak leaves and nesting birds—held the stark, printed type in a gentle embrace. In the capital ‘O’, a monkish artist had painted a tiny, brilliant sunrise.

He was not delivering it. He was simply holding it, feeling its balance. The spiritual seeking that had been a burden was now a part of his architecture, the hidden joinery of his self.

His wife, Anna, emerged from the shop, her own hands dusted with flour from the baker’s next door. She smiled at him, a smile that held their shared history, their quiet life in Strasbourg, their future which was unwritten. She linked her arm with his.

“Does it hold?” she asked, echoing the old, desperate question.

He looked down at the book, then out at the city, clean and sharp in the washed air. The cathedral spires reached for the same sky that sheltered the humble shops. The world was full of noise and shouting, of new presses churning out decrees and arguments and lies and truths. The great siege of the mind was raging.

But here, in his hands, was a small, strong frame. A space for a whisper. A joint made to flex, not to break.

“It holds,” he said.

And together, they walked down the shining cobbles, not away from the future, but into its midst. He was no longer a man bracing against a settling rain, but a man walking in the clear light after the storm, carrying a small, perfect proof that the hand and the machine, the spirit and the letter, the seeker and the found, could share the same page. The story was not over. The next page was blank, and the frame was ready.

# Chapter 13

## **Chapter 13**

The clear light after the storm lasted a week. It was a week of startling, crystalline mornings where the Rhine seemed a sheet of hammered silver, and the cathedral’s sandstone glowed like honey. In that light, the small, perfect proof Tilman carried in his mind felt solid, a cornerstone laid. He and Anna walked the Hohe Straße not as fugitives from their own lives, but as participants. He worked in Peter’s shop, the scent of oak gall ink and fresh paper a familiar incense. He saw his border on the pages of the completed “Garden of Prayers,” the printed text cradled by his carved leaves, and the quiet rightness of it hummed in his bones. The joint held.

But Cologne was not a city of static light. It was a city of trade winds, of river fogs that rolled in to smother the sun, of pressures building and releasing. The spiritual seeking that had clarified into a form of making did not exempt him from the world’s friction; it merely gave him a better tool to feel it.

The change began with a quality of silence. It was not the peaceful quiet of Anna’s bakery at dawn, but the thick, watchful hush that falls between the dropping of a gauntlet and the movement to pick it up. Peter, usually a fountain of gossip and grumbling, took to staring out the shop’s leaded window, his polishing cloth idle in his hand. The apprentices, Hans and Matthias, stopped their boisterous jostling and bent over their frames with an intense, theatrical concentration. The normal stream of minor clerics, wealthy merchants’ stewards, and itinerant scholars who came to commission devotional works or purchase approved texts slowed to a trickle, then ceased.

It was Anna who named the pressure. She returned from the market, her basket lighter than it should have been, her face carefully neutral. She set down her purchases on their shared worktable: a scant bundle of leeks, a smaller wheel of cheese, a twist of paper containing pepper that cost twice what it had the week before.

“The Archbishop’s men are on the Hohe Straße,” she said, her voice low, as if the walls of their rented room had grown ears. “Two of them. In plain clothes, but you can tell by the boots. And by the way the fishwives stop shouting when they pass.”

Tilman felt the old, familiar tightening between his shoulder blades, the instinct to brace. “Looking for what?”

“Not for what. For whom.” She met his gaze. “They are asking after printers. Not the guild masters. The journeymen. The new men. Those who work with… novel arrangements.”

The “Garden of Prayers” sat in a neat stack of twenty copies on a shelf by the door, ready for the priest from St. Maria’s who had commissioned them. It was a pious work, orthodox, filled with approved meditations. Its only novelty was its making: the marriage of Peter’s sturdy press, Tilman’s carved frame, and a hired illuminator’s brush. A harmless harmony. But in a city where the very air was thickening with doctrinal suspicion, harmony itself could be suspect. A novel arrangement was a deviation. A deviation was a potential heresy.

“Peter will know what to say,” Tilman said, more to convince himself than her.

“Peter,” Anna said, brushing flour from her sleeve, “is a man with a shop, two apprentices, and a debt to the wool-merchant’s guild. His first loyalty is to mortar and ledger.”

She was not accusing, merely stating a geometry as fixed as the lines of the streets outside. Tilman’s clarity of the previous week—the seeker found in the act of making—now felt like a lantern carried into a vast, damp cavern. It illuminated his immediate hands, the grain of the wood on his bench, but the darkness beyond its circle had weight and movement.

The knock, when it came two days later, was not the thunder of authority. It was polite, firm: the tap of a man who expects entry. Tilman was alone in the shop, trimming a freshly printed broadside—a proclamation of a civic feast day—with a sharp knife. Peter was at the guildhall.

The man who entered was not in Archbishop’s livery. He wore a dark, serviceable robe of a clerical cut, but without insignia. His face was long, austere, the skin stretched tight over prominent bones, his eyes the colour of old ash. He moved with a quiet efficiency, his gaze sweeping the room—the press, the type cases, the stacks of paper, the drying lines—before settling on Tilman.

“You are the wood-carver. The one from Strasbourg.”

It was not a question. Tilman set down his knife. “I am Tilman. I work for Master Peter.”

“So I am told.” The man’s hands, clasped before him, were clean, the nails perfectly trimmed. A scholar’s hands, or a clerk’s. “My name is Werner. I am a secretary in the service of the Vicar-General.” He said it softly, as if confessing a minor sin. “There is a matter of clarification. Regarding certain works produced here.”

“We produce many works,” Tilman said, his mouth dry. “All with the proper licenses. The Master sees to it.”

“Of course.” Werner offered a thin smile that did not touch his eyes. “Industry is a virtue. It is the *manner* of industry that sometimes requires… examination. The world is in flux. New tools can be put to old errors. Or,” he paused, his ash-eyes fixed on Tilman, “to new ones. I understand you have skill not just with decorative vines, but with architectural forms. Frames. Spaces that hold text.”

Tilman felt the conversation like a physical probe, seeking a weakness in a joint. “I carve what is commissioned.”

“A prudent answer.” Werner drifted to the shelf, his finger hovering over the stack of the “Garden of Prayers.” He did not touch them. “This is your work? The border?”

“It is.”

“It is finely done. It does not compete with the holy text. It *enfolds* it. A subtle distinction. Almost a theological one.” He turned from the shelf. “Where did you learn this principle? Not from the guild carvers here. Their work is bold, separate. A celebration of the craft itself. Yours seeks to… disappear. To create a silence around the word.”

The analysis was so acute it felt violent. Tilman’s spiritual seeking, his private resolution, was being laid bare by a stranger with a clerk’s voice. “A frame should serve what it holds. Not shout over it.”

“A humble sentiment.” Werner nodded slowly. “Humility can be a deep well. It can also be a disguise. The heretics in Mainz, the ones who scatter their poisoned pamphlets, they too affect a humble style. A plain frame, so to speak, for a corrosive idea. They say the machine of the press liberates truth from the monopoly of the learned. What do you say?”

The air in the shop grew close. Tilman thought of the weight of the rain in Cologne, how it seeped into everything. This was a different kind of saturation. “I say a tool has no conscience. Only the hand that guides it.”

“And the hand must be guided, must it not?” Werner’s voice dropped to a conspiratorial murmur. “By proper authority. By approved doctrine. Lest the tool make a monster of us all. Tell me, wood-carver, when you create this… this silent space for the word, whose word do you imagine filling it? The Church’s? Or your own?”

It was the question that had haunted him for years, the core of his seeking. Now, posed as an inquisition, his hard-won answer felt fragile. “The space is for the reader’s prayer. It is a gateway, not a prison.”

Werner studied him for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he gave a small, almost imperceptible sigh, as if a minor entry in a ledger had been confirmed. “A pretty thought. Gateways swing both ways. They can let light in, or let danger out.” He moved toward the door. “My clarification is complete. For now. Continue your work. Master Peter’s shop has a sound reputation. It would be a pity to see it… complicated.”

He left as quietly as he had entered, leaving behind a silence louder than any press-clamour.

When Peter returned, Tilman told him of the visit. The master printer’s face, usually florid, turned a sickly grey. He walked to his strongbox, unlocked it, and stared inside at the guild certificates, the licenses, the promissory notes.

“Werner,” he muttered. “The Vicar-General’s bloodhound. He sniffs for the scent of Luther, even where there is only incense.” He closed the box with a definitive thud. “We must be seen to be beyond reproach. No more ‘novel arrangements.’ The ‘Garden’ is done. Your border is beautiful, Tilman, but it whispers of a mind that thinks too much about space and silence. In times like these, it is safer to shout with the crowd.”

The directive was not cruel, merely survival. Tilman’s next commission was for a series of blatant, gaudy borders for a psalter for a wealthy burgher: thick, intertwined grapevines heavy with clusters, fat cherubs blowing trumpets. Work that celebrated its own ornament, that left no room for a reader’s breath. It was technically demanding, and spiritually suffocating. As his gouge cut into the pearwood, he felt the old dislocation return. The joint between his inner life and his outward craft, which he had believed fused, began to ache as if under a new, insidious strain.

He carried the ache home. Anna saw it in the set of his shoulders. She said nothing, but her own movements became more deliberate, the ordering of their few possessions more precise, as if in anticipation of a sudden departure.

The hook was set not by Werner, but by a boy. A grimy, breathless apprentice from a printer near the river docks who slipped into Peter’s shop at twilight, his eyes wide. He thrust a folded, unprinted sheet into Tilman’s hands.

“For you. From the Englishman.”

“The Englishman” was a phrase used for a certain type of client: not a nationality, but a disposition. It meant one interested in works of a more… speculative nature. The man who had commissioned the “Garden of Prayers” was such a one, a retired scholastic who collected mystical texts.

Tilman unfolded the sheet. It was not a message. It was a single, printed page. At its top was a crude but powerful woodcut: a towering, multi-turreted castle named “Babylon,” under siege by a host of tiny, determined figures labelled “The Spirit of Truth.” At the bottom, a fortress named “Zion” stood pristine on a hill. The text between was in German, a flowing, passionate argument that the true Church was not stone and ceremony, but the invisible congregation of the faithful heart. It was unsigned. It was incendiary.

Printed in the margin, in a swift, cramped hand, was a note: *The frame for this truth remains to be carved. Will your hand guide the tool? A friend.*

Tilman’s blood turned to ice, then to fire. This was the “poisoned pamphlet” Werner had spoken of. To possess it was dangerous. To be invited to illustrate it was a leap into the abyss. The quiet space he sought to create—was this the word meant to fill it? This shouting, polemical, glorious, and treasonous word?

He burned the page in the small hearth of their room, watching the castle of Babylon blacken and curl into ash. But the image was seared into his mind. And the question would not burn: *Will your hand guide the tool?*

He was no longer walking in the clear light. He was standing at a crossroads in a gathering fog, the weight of Cologne’s greasy, insistent rain beginning once more to fall. The spiritual seeking was over. The spiritual choice had begun. The perfect, proven joint was about to be tested by a force it was never designed to hold. He had built a frame for a whisper. But the world was now full of shouts, and one of them was calling his name, not from the distant spires, but from the perilous, ink-stained depths of the machine itself.

## **Chapter 14**

The fog was not a metaphor. It had risen from the Rhine with the dusk, a cold, woolen exhalation that swallowed the lower spires of the great cathedral and reduced the world to a sphere of ten paces. Sounds were muffled, distorted: the clop of a distant horse became the tap of a ghostly cane; a drunk’s song from a tavern doorway bled into a mournful, formless drone. Tilman walked through it, the ash of the burned pamphlet a taste in the back of his throat. The crossroads was not a place on any map. It was this moment, this muffled suspension between one breath and the next. The machine, as the pamphlet had called it, was not just Gutenberg’s press. It was the whole grinding apparatus of the world—law, Church, guild, custom—and it had just presented him with a lever and asked him to choose where to set his weight.

He found himself not at his own door, but at the mouth of the alley that led to Werner’s workshop. The sign of the locked book creaked on its iron bracket, a lonely, rhythmic complaint in the damp. Light bled around the shutters, not the warm, pooling glow of a hearth, but the hard, mineral gleam of the work-lamp. Tilman stood for a long time, watching his own breath join the greater fog. He had come for answers, or perhaps for a voice to argue against the one in his head. But as he raised his hand to knock, he knew he had really come to be seen. To have his choice witnessed by the one man who would understand its contours.

The door opened before his knuckles touched wood. Werner stood there, a graver in one hand, a linen polishing cloth in the other. He wore no apron. His eyes were the colour of slate under this flat sky, and they held no surprise. “The fog brings strange pilgrims,” he said, his voice low. “Come in. You’re letting the damp in, and it warps the wood.”

The workshop was a cave of ordered industry. The great press stood shrouded in its canvas cover, a dormant beast. On the workbench, under the lamp’s unforgiving eye, lay a newly set forme. Tilman glanced at it, his craftsman’s eye registering the lines of type, the waiting spaces for the woodcuts. It was a page of Cicero. Safe. Proven. A joint tested by centuries.

“You look,” Werner said, setting down his tools, “like a man who has just seen his own ghost.”

“I have been asked to carve a frame,” Tilman said. The words felt too loud in the quiet room.

Werner did not move. He picked up a small block of pearwood, his thumb rubbing its smooth, blank face. “A frame for what?”

“For a castle named Babylon. And a fortress named Zion.”

The only sound was the slow hiss of the lamp’s flame. Werner’s thumb stopped moving. He placed the wood block down with a precise, final click. “So. It has found you. The ‘friend’ is efficient.”

“You know of it.”

“I know of *them*,” Werner corrected. He walked to a locked cabinet, produced a key from a chain around his neck, and opened it. He did not withdraw a pamphlet, but a small, bound sheaf of manuscript pages, their edges soft with handling. “They move in shadows, but they are not fools. They seek craftsmen, not zealots. A shaky hand makes for poor type. A fervent heart makes for poor judgement in the spacing of a line.” He offered the sheaf to Tilman. “Read. Not to agree. To understand the geometry of the thing.”

Tilman took the pages. The handwriting was different from the note in the margin—several hands, in fact, some scholarly, some rough. It was not a single polemic, but a collection: copied letters, fragments of sermons, passages of scripture with furious annotations. The arguments circled a single, dizzying point: that the truth of God was not mediated through priests, nor contained in Latin, nor bought with indulgences, but was a direct scripture, a living word in the language of the ploughman and the carpenter. It was the “Garden of Prayers” stripped of its allegorical ivy and set on a bare, rocky hill. It was the whisper given a trumpet.

He looked up. “This is the poison.”

“It is the medicine,” Werner said flatly. “Or so they believe. And poison and medicine are often the same substance, distinguished only by the dose and the constitution of the patient. The Archbishop’s men call it heresy. The Pope in Rome would call it a fire to be extinguished. The man who wrote that pamphlet… he calls it the only air worth breathing.”

“And you?” Tilman asked. “What do you call it?”

Werner’s gaze was unflinching. “I call it type. I call it ink and rag paper and the pressure of a screw. I am a printer. My loyalty is to the word, not the dogma. But I am also a man who lives in Cologne. I know that some words are flames, and to handle them is to risk burning down your own house with all who dwell in it.” He nodded at the pages in Tilman’s hands. “They ask you to carve a frame. To give their shouting truth a beauty, a gravity, that crude type alone cannot provide. They believe an image can bypass the mind and speak directly to the spirit. They are not wrong.”

Tilman felt the weight of the blank wood block in his mind. He saw the lines he would cut: the defiant strength of Zion, the crumbling arrogance of Babylon. He could already feel the grain guiding his gouge. It would be a magnificent piece. The best work of his life. “And if I say no?”

“Then you say no,” Werner shrugged. “You return to your saints and your choir stalls. You carve frames for whispers. You will sleep, perhaps. But you will always wonder what your hand might have built.”

“And if I say yes?”

Werner was silent for a full minute. He looked not at Tilman, but at his press, the great silent engine of his life. “Then you step from the fog onto a narrow path with a sheer drop on either side. You will work in secret. You will trust no one, and you will be trusted only as far as your usefulness extends. The work will be its own reward, and its own punishment. And you will become a different kind of craftsman. Not one who serves the world as it is, but one who labours, stitch by hidden stitch, on the shroud for the old world, or the swaddling for the new. I cannot tell you which.”

The choice, laid out with the cold clarity of a typeset line. Tilman thought of Katarina, of the quiet life they were piecing together from splinters. He thought of the cathedral, its vastness a containment for mystery. Then he thought of the burned page, the image of the castle that would not fade. It was a better, truer line than any he had drawn for the canons.

“I need to see it,” Tilman heard himself say. “The machine. Not the idea. The actual, ink-stained thing. I need to see the hand that holds the lever.”

Werner studied him. A flicker of something—respect, or pity—crossed his face. “That is the only wise question you have asked tonight.” He went to the back of the workshop, to a door Tilman had assumed led to a storage closet. He produced another key. “The ‘friend’ wishes to meet the hand that may guide the tool. Come.”

*

The journey was a descent. Werner led him through the closet, down a set of worn stone steps that smelled of wet mortar and rat, and into a cellar that belonged to another building entirely. They traversed a low, brick-vaulted passageway, the fog replaced by a total, suffocating blackness broken only by Werner’s small, shuttered lantern. The sounds of the city vanished. The only noise was the scuttle of unseen life and the drip of perpetual seepage. Tilman’s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic prisoner. This was no longer a spiritual choice. It was a physical conspiracy.

They emerged into another cellar, this one vast and high-ceilinged. The air was different here: dry, carrying the familiar, comforting scents of linseed oil, pine resin, and the sharp, metallic tang of type metal. And there was sound—the soft, rhythmic *shush-shush* of a ink ball being worked, the clink of metal, a low murmur of voices.

The lantern light spread, revealing not a dungeon, but a workshop that mirrored Werner’s in its order, but surpassed it in scale and stark purpose. Two presses stood side by side, their skeletons stark and powerful. Composing stones held formes not of Cicero, but of tight, uncompromising German text. Piles of fresh paper, the good, creamy rag-stuff, stood in reams. And in the centre, bending over a proof sheet, was a man.

He was not what Tilman had expected. He was neither a wild-eyed prophet nor a furtive conspirator. He was of middle years, solidly built, with the broad shoulders of a smith or a farmer. He wore a practical leather jerkin over a plain woolen shirt, stained with ink at the cuffs. His face was broad, intelligent, etched with lines of concentration, and when he looked up at their approach, his eyes were a calm, steady blue. They were the eyes of a man who measured twice before cutting.

“Master Werner,” the man said, his voice a quiet baritone. “And you have brought the carver of whispers.” His gaze settled on Tilman, appraising, but not unkind. “I am Johann. Thank you for coming.”

Tilman found he could not speak. He was staring at the proof sheet. It was the same pamphlet, the “Babylon and Zion,” but here it was whole, perfect, the type crisp and black as a starless night. The blank space for the woodcut gaped like a missing tooth.

Johann followed his look. “It lacks the final witness,” he said. “The text speaks to the mind. But the image…” He tapped his chest. “It speaks here. It is the banner men will remember when the words blur. It is the anchor for the truth.” He picked up a piece of type, holding it between ink-stained finger and thumb. “We build with these little leaden bricks. We build a fortress of ideas. Your art would be its gate, its standard flying from the highest tower. Will you build with us?”

The directness was disarming. This was not a mystic’s invitation, but a foreman’s request. Tilman’s voice returned, rough. “You risk much.”

“We do,” Johann nodded. “To print the Latin Vulgate is an act of commerce. To print God’s word in the language of the people who work and sweat and pray is an act of war. The Archbishop has a hundred spies. The penalty is not a fine. It is fire. For the books, and for the men who make them.” He set the type down. “But tell me, carver. You have spent your life making beauty for the established house of God. Does it satisfy? Does the whisper fill the chamber?”

Tilman thought of the “Garden of Prayers,” hidden in its box. He thought of the canon’s disinterest, of the way his work disappeared into the vast, indifferent glory of the cathedral. “It is a quiet service,” he said finally.

“The world has had quiet service for a thousand years,” Johann said, not with anger, but with the certainty of a man stating a geometric proof. “And in that quiet, error has grown like rot in the walls. We are not destroying the house. We are exposing the timbers to the light, so the true structure can be seen. We are the carpenters of that light.” He gestured to the waiting space on the proof. “This is your chisel. This is your timber.”

Tilman walked to the press. He ran his fingers over the smooth, cool metal of the platen, over the precise, relentless rows of type. This was the machine’s heart. It did not care what it printed. It would apply its perfect, even pressure to a prayer book or a blasphemy with the same impartial force. His own craft was a slow, singular conversation between hand and wood. This was multiplication. This was an army of ideas, each soldier identical, marching out into the fog of the world.

He turned to Johann. “If I do this… the block. It cannot be traced. The style must be… anonymous.”

A faint smile touched Johann’s lips. “We are all anonymous here. The work has a name. The workers do not. You will carve here, in this room. The block will be set, printed, and then destroyed. No proof will exist but the pages that go out into the world. You will be a ghost in the machine.”

It was the final seal on the choice. Anonymity. To create his masterpiece and never claim it, to see it borne away on a secret river of print, to never know where it landed or what it sparked. It was the utter dissolution of the craftsman’s pride. It was also, he realized, the purest form of the spiritual seeking he had begun with: a work done not for glory, not for guild, not even for a patron, but for the idea itself.

He looked at Werner, who gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. It was not an endorsement, but an acknowledgement of the path’s reality.

“I will need my tools,” Tilman said, his voice now clear in the cellar’s stillness. “And a piece of pearwood. Close-grained. Without flaw.”

Johann’s steady blue eyes held his. The moment stretched, filled with the weight of unspoken oaths. Then Johann extended his hand, not in a gesture of feudal fealty, but in the simple, firm clasp of one working man to another. “It will be provided.”

The grip was strong, the palm calloused. It was the hand of a man who worked. Tilman released it, and the pact was made. He was no longer at a crossroads. He had taken the step. The fog outside was now inside him, a permanent, concealing medium in which he would have to learn to see.

“Begin tonight,” Johann said, turning back to the proof. “The press is hungry. The world is waiting, though it knows it not.”

Werner led him back through the labyrinth. The journey up was a silent one. When they re-entered the familiar workshop, the fog of Cologne pressing at the shutters seemed trivial, a mere weather. Tilman felt a strange, cold clarity.

“You have stepped onto the path,” Werner said, locking the cellar door. “Remember, Tilman. You are carving for a press now. Your lines must be bold. They must hold their form under great pressure. They must be deep enough to hold the ink, but clean enough to release it. It is a different kind of truth.”

Tilman nodded. He was already thinking in reverse, in the mirror-image the block would require. He was thinking of negative space, of the lines that would stand in black relief. He was thinking of Babylon, not as a vague symbol, but as a specific, crumbling edifice of pride.

“I will return after matins,” he said. “With my tools.”

He left Werner’s shop and walked home through the enduring fog. The city around him was a dream, a pale phantom of itself. He was a ghost within it, carrying a secret that was both a key and a weapon. Katarina was asleep when he entered, her breathing soft and regular in the darkness. He stood watching her for a long time, the warmth of their room a palpable contrast to the cellar’s intellectual chill. He had drawn her into a life of uncertainty. Now he was plunging them both into active danger. The guilt was a sharp, physical pain beneath his breastbone.

He did not sleep. He sat by the dead hearth, where the ashes of the pamphlet had long grown cold, and sharpened his gouges and his gravers until their edges could catch the faintest gleam of moonlight through the shutter-slats. He was honing the tools that would give form to a shout. The spiritual seeking had ended in a cellar, not a cathedral. The choice was made. Now came the labour, the secret, meticulous construction of a frame meant to break the world open. The perfect joint of his old life was behind him. Ahead lay the relentless, testing pressure of the screw.

## **Chapter 15**

The grey light of a Cologne dawn was a feeble thing, a slow seep of pallor into the room that seemed to thicken the air rather than illuminate it. It found Tilman where he had remained, motionless in the chair by the dead hearth, the sharpened tools laid out on the floor before him like surgical instruments. His hands rested on his knees, palms up. They did not tremble. The night’s vigil had burned away the last of the indecision, the guilt, the feverish excitement. What remained was a cold, granular focus, the kind a stonemason must feel when he first sets his chisel to a fresh block. The design was in his mind, complete. It existed in perfect, mirrored clarity. His task was not to create it, but to excavate it from the plank of pear wood leaning against the wall.

Katarina stirred. He heard the shift of straw in the mattress, the soft intake of breath that meant she was awake and assessing the room. She did not speak immediately. He could feel her gaze on his back, reading the set of his shoulders, the unnatural stillness.

“You did not come to bed,” she said. Her voice was husky with sleep, but held no accusation.

“No.”

She rose, the blanket whispering around her. She came to stand beside his chair, not touching him, following his line of sight to the tools, then to the blank wood. Her own hands, usually so quick and capable, hung at her sides. She understood the silence. It was the silence before a descent into a mine, or the signing of a contract.

“It is decided, then.”

“It is.”

“What will you carve?”

He turned his head to look up at her. Her face was pale in the weak light, her hair a dark cascade over her shift. He saw the fear there, but it was held in check by a ferocious curiosity. She had not married a safe man. She had married a man who saw shapes in the grain of things.

“A warning,” he said. “A tower.”

He watched her absorb it. Her eyes flickered, not with confusion, but with a swift, connective logic. She knew his mind. The pamphlets, the cellar, the weight of Werner’s words. A tower could only be one thing.

“Babylon,” she breathed.

“Not the symbol. The machine. I will show it as it is: a thing of human engineering, of pride and mortar. And I will show it cracking. From the top down.”

He stood, his joints stiff. He crossed to the wood, running a hand over its surface. It was smooth, close-grained, a perfect block for holding fine lines. “Werner says I must carve for the press. Bold lines. Deep enough to hold the ink, clean enough to release it. It is a different truth.”

“It is a dangerous one.” She said it flatly, a fact as plain as the wood itself. “They will know it is you. Your hand is in every cut.”

“They will suspect. They will not know. The block will be anonymous. That is the point of the press. The words, the image… they come from nowhere and everywhere. They float on the river of the city, and no man can find their source.”

“Unless they follow the river upstream.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “Tilman, they are not fools. They have informers. They have men who love the sound of coins on a table.”

He turned to her then, finally, and took her hands. They were cold. “I know. This is what I must ask of you. Your part is the most dangerous of all. You must know nothing. If they come, if they question you, your confusion must be perfect. You are a carpenter’s wife. Your husband carves decorative panels and prayer-niches. He is troubled by strange ideas sometimes, but he is a good man, a quiet man. You have seen no pamphlets. You have met no one named Werner. You worry for my soul, not for my politics.”

Her fingers tightened on his. “You ask me to lie.”

“I ask you to survive. The image is mine. The risk is mine. Your safety is all that will make the risk bearable.”

A complex struggle played out on her face. Pride warred with pragmatism, love with fury. She wanted to be part of the conspiracy, to share the burden. She also understood, with a clarity that surpassed his own in matters of practical threat, that the strongest defence was a wall of genuine ignorance.

“I will be your blind wife,” she said, the words bitter on her tongue. “I will see nothing, hear nothing. But you will not carve it here.”

He had expected this. “The workshop is too exposed. The sound…”

“The sound, the smell of the shavings, a visitor seeing the block in progress… no. You need a cell. A true one.”

“Werner’s cellar.”

She shook her head sharply. “Too far. You cannot be seen coming and going at all hours from that street. It is watched. It must be somewhere between here and there. Somewhere no one thinks to look.”

She released his hands and began to pace, her bare feet soundless on the packed earth floor. He saw the mind that managed their household accounts, that haggled with merchants, that foresaw the winter’s need for firewood in the height of summer, now turning its focus to the logistics of sedition.

“The old tanner’s shed,” she said, stopping abruptly. “By the stream, behind the fuller’s yard. The roof is half-gone, and it stinks of old alum and rot. No one goes there. The fuller uses it to dump his ash. There is a corner still sound, dry enough. You can work there after dusk. I will say you have taken commission work in Deutz, that you are working late for a wealthy patron across the river. It will explain your absences, the tiredness.”

It was a good plan. It was, in fact, a brilliant one. The mundane cover of extra work was unassailable. The location was isolated, yet close. The stink would keep the curious away.

“You have a mind for this,” he said, a strange admiration colouring his voice.

“I have a mind for keeping you alive,” she corrected him, her tone still sharp. “Now. You must sleep. You cannot carve a steady line with a shaking hand. I will wake you at noon. Then you will eat, and you will go to your workshop and be seen carving a set of choir stalls for Saint Andreas. You will be dull and visible. When the light fails, you will go to your tanner’s shed.”

He did not argue. The weight of the coming night’s work was a physical pressure behind his eyes. He let her lead him to the bed. The straw was warm from her body. As he lay down, the world of images—the inverted lines, the sweeping curve of a crumbling parapet—swam behind his closed eyelids. He felt her lie down beside him, her back to his, a line of tense warmth. The gulf between them was new, and it was of his making. It was the necessary distance between the bomb-maker and those outside the workshop. He fell into a sleep that was not rest, but a shallow, grey pool of half-formed thoughts, where the tapping of a mallet echoed in a vast, dark space.

*

The day was a performance. Tilman moved through it with the deliberate, slightly weary focus of a craftsman burdened with a lucrative but tedious commission. In his actual workshop, he did indeed work on the choir stalls, his gouges peeling long, sweet curls of lime wood from a flowing vine pattern. He spoke to the deacon from Saint Andreas about the progress. He complained, mildly, about the price of good glue. He was a man embedded in the ordinary commerce of the city.

His real mind was elsewhere. It was tracing the great, tapering cylinder of the tower, built not of stone but of tiers, each a kingdom of its own. He saw the proud faces in the windows, the merchants and bishops and princes, each level looking down on the one below. And he saw the flaw, the hairline crack of divine judgement starting at the pinnacle, a jagged black lightning bolt of truth splitting the elegant geometry. His hands worked the lime wood, but his soul was rehearsing the cuts on the pear wood: the strong verticals that would read as white space, the deep, shadowed grooves that would print black.

When the Angelus bell rang, he cleaned his tools with methodical care, banked his small fire, and left. He walked not towards the river and home, but east, skirting the cathedral square where the evening crowds were gathering. The sky was the colour of a bruise, yellow and purple at the edges, deepening to a morbid blue overhead. The smell of the river—water, fish, and the dank scent of the tanneries—grew stronger.

The fuller’s yard was quiet, the great wooden hammers for beating cloth stilled for the night. Behind it, the stream was a sluggish, dark ribbon frothing with the soap and waste from the yards. The tanner’s shed leaned precariously, a skeleton of rotten timbers clad in sagging, stinking hides. Tilman pushed aside a loose board, the reek of centuries of decay and chemical rot washing over him. It was the smell of forgotten things.

Inside, in the last of the failing light, he saw the ash pile. And beside it, as Katarina had promised, a corner where the roof, by some accident of collapse, still held. The earth was dry. It was a crypt, a perfect, filthy cell.

He had brought a sack. From it, he took a small, shuttered lantern, a bottle of oil, his toolbox, and the pear wood block, wrapped in sacking. He set the block on a flat stone, lit the lantern, and closed its shutters to a thin slit that threw a blade of yellow light onto the wood’s pale face.

The world shrank to that illuminated rectangle. The sounds of the city faded—the distant shouts, the barking dogs, the bells. There was only the whisper of the stream, the occasional scuttle of a rat, and the profound silence of his own concentration. He took up a piece of charcoal, its brittleness a contrast to the wood’s hard promise.

He did not sketch the tower. He inscribed it. The charcoal hissed as he drew the central axis, a firm, unwavering vertical. Then, with a geometric precision that felt like an act of devotion, he began to block in the tiers. He did not draw the people, not yet. He drew the architecture of arrogance. Each level was slightly narrower than the one below, but each was more ornate, more crowded with architectural vanity—pointed arches, delicate balustrades, soaring spires that were miniature echoes of the whole. It was a cathedral to ambition.

He worked for hours, the charcoal wearing down to a nub in his fingers. The tower grew, consuming the block. It was not a beautiful image; it was a chilling one. It was too perfect, too grand. Its order was oppressive. And then, from the very top of the highest spire, he drew the crack. It was not a random fissure. It was a deliberate, violent line, a cleaving. It forked as it descended, splintering the meticulous order, breaking arches, toppling tiny spires. At its base, where the crack met the foundations, he drew the first suggestion of chaos: a few figures, no larger than ants, looking up in terror or running in vain.

He sat back. His neck ached. The lantern’s oil was low. The image was complete in charcoal. Now came the translation, the act of betrayal. He must carve away everything that was not the crack, not the falling masonry, not the terrified faces. The white of the page would be the tower’s pristine facade. The black ink would be the judgement within it.

He selected a graver, a fine, lozenge-shaped tool for outlining. He set its point at the top of the crack, took a breath that was also a prayer, and pushed.

The sound was crisp, definitive. A tiny curl of pear wood, pale as a blonde hair, lifted from the surface. He had made the first irreversible mark. He followed the charcoal line, the tool’s handle cool in his palm, its metal tip biting into the resistant grain with a soft, tearing sound. This was the true labour. This was the slow, physical making of the idea into a weapon. Each cut was a commitment. A slip, a too-deep gouge, and the block would be ruined. He worked with a tense, fluid patience, his body coiled over the stone, the world beyond the lantern’s slit nonexistent.

He did not hear the footsteps outside.

It was a change in the texture of the silence that alerted him—a cessation of the stream’s whisper, as if a foot had pressed into the soft bank. His hand froze, the graver poised a hair’s breadth from the wood. He held his breath. His heart was a sudden, hard drum in his throat.

The loose board at the entrance creaked. Not a push, but a subtle pressure.

Tilman’s gaze shot to the lantern. The slit of light was a beacon in the absolute dark of the shed. In one fluid motion, he closed the shutter completely, plunging himself into a blackness so complete it felt solid. He lowered himself silently to the earth, his hand finding the handle of a broad gouge from his open toolbox.

He heard breathing. Slow, deliberate. Not the quick pant of an animal. Human.

A voice came then, low and familiar, laced with a grim amusement. “A tanner’s shed, Tilman? Your fastidious soul must be weeping.”

Werner.

The relief that flooded him was so intense it left him weak. He let out the breath he’d been holding, a shuddering sound in the dark. “How did you find me?”

A strike of flint, a spark that bloomed into the small flame of a tallow candle. Werner’s face appeared in the shaky circle of light, his expression unreadable. He held the candle aloft, taking in the shed, the ash heap, the stone, the shrouded block.

“Katarina,” he said simply. “She is a better strategist than both of us. She found me at the market. She thought you should not be alone in this, not entirely. And she was right.”

Tilman stood, his legs stiff. “She told you?”

“She told me nothing. She asked me, in a voice full of wifely concern, if I knew of any good suppliers of pear wood in Deutz, as her husband was taking on work there and might need extra. It was a masterful performance. I understood the question beneath it.” Werner stepped closer, the candlelight falling on the block. “May I?”

Tilman nodded, unwrapping the sacking.

Werner bent low, his eyes scanning the dense charcoal drawing. He was silent for a long time. The only sound was the drip of moisture from the rotten roof somewhere in the darkness. When he straightened, his face was grave.

“It is… formidable,” he said, the word chosen with care. “You have understood the assignment. This is not a preacher’s illustration. This is an engineer’s report on a structural failure. It will frighten them because it is so specific. It speaks their language of power and order, and then it shows that language breaking.” He pointed a blunt finger at the crack. “This is good. This is the sword of the spirit, drawn as a flaw in masonry.” He then pointed to the base, to the tiny, sketched figures. “These are less good. They are still symbols. The mind that sees this image must not be allowed the comfort of thinking ‘those people.’ It must think ‘I.’ You must make the viewer feel the stone falling beside his own ear.”

“How?” Tilman asked, the craftsman’s problem overriding the conspirator’s fear.

Werner leaned in again. “Do not show them running. Show them frozen. One, here, looking directly out from the block. Meeting the viewer’s eye. His face not in terror, but in a dawning, awful comprehension. He is not running from the tower. He is realizing he *is* the tower. That is the hook. That is what will turn their stomachs.”

It was a stroke of genius. Tilman saw it immediately. A single figure, carved in clean, detailed lines, his gaze a bridge from the printed page to the soul of the man holding it. The personal accusation.

“I will change it,” Tilman said.

Werner nodded. “I will leave you to it. I am but a visitor from Deutz, inquiring about pear wood.” He placed his candle on the stone beside Tilman’s dark lantern. “You have enough light. I will take this one. Remember, the block is only half the work. The ink, the paper, the press—they are the other half. The image must survive all of them. Your lines must be fortresses.”

He turned to go, then paused at the broken board. “You are not a ghost, Tilman. You are a smith, hammering in the dark. The sound carries farther than you think. Be sure you are hammering the right metal.”

Then he was gone, his footsteps fading into the murmur of the stream. Tilman was alone again, but the solitude was different now. It was shared. He reopened his lantern, the blade of light falling once more on the tower. He took a rag, wiped away the ants at the base, and with a fresh piece of charcoal, he drew the new figure. A man in a merchant’s robe, his head tilted up, not at the falling stone, but outwards, towards the unseen viewer. On his face, Tilman drew not panic, but a slow, dreadful unraveling. The *understanding*.

He worked until the charcoal was dust on his fingers and the candle Werner had left guttered in a pool of wax. He had outlined the entire central crack and begun the arduous work of clearing the areas that would print white—the sky around the tower, the unbroken sections of masonry. The shed was a tomb of pear wood shavings, pale and delicate as insect wings, smelling of fresh-cut fruit amidst the decay.

He wrapped the block, hid his tools in a crevice in the stone wall, and doused the light. Stepping out into the pre-dawn was like rising from a grave. The air, though still tainted, felt clean and vast. The city was a silhouette of black teeth against a grey wool sky. He walked home, his body aching with a profound fatigue, his mind humming with a strange, lucid energy.

Katarina was awake, tending the small fire. She looked at him as he entered, taking in the smell of the shed on his clothes, the hollows under his eyes, the peculiar light in them. She asked no questions. She handed him a bowl of thin porridge.

“The deacon from Saint Andreas came by,” she said, her voice carefully neutral. “He was pleased with the progress on the vines. He hopes the Madonna’s halo can be more intricate.”

Tilman ate, the warm food a shock to his system. “I will add more florets,” he said, the words belonging to another man, in another life.

He slept for two hours, a dead, dreamless sleep, and then rose to become that other man again. The performance resumed. But as he carved the florets on the Madonna’s halo, his mind was in the shed, clearing space around the merchant’s face, deepening the line of the crack. His life had bifurcated, cleanly and completely. There was the surface life, of light and lime wood and acceptable commerce. And there was the subterranean life, of darkness and pear wood and treasonous truth.

Days fell into this rhythm. Dawn to dusk: the saint’s halo, the choir stalls, the discussions of grain and glue. Dusk to dawn: the tower, the crack, the graver’s whisper. He became a creature of two skins. The connection to Katarina, though strained by the necessary deceit, took on a new, deeper current. Their conversations were layers of code and care. A question about supper was a question about his safety. A comment on the weather was a assessment of the risk outside. Their love was no longer just a warmth; it was a conspiracy of its own.

After a week, the block was nearly finished. The tower stood in stark, negative relief. The merchant’s face, with its haunting, direct gaze, was the most detailed part, each eyelash, each line of dismay carved with a precision that bordered on the devotional. It was the anchor of the image, the point where the viewer’s soul would be snagged and pulled in.

On the eighth night, he began the final stage: clearing the large, open areas of sky. This required a broad gouge and a mallet. It was noisy work. The *tap-tap-tap* of the mallet on the gouge’s handle was a sharp, percussive sound in the silent shed. He lost himself in the rhythm, in the satisfying chunks of wood that lifted away.

He did not hear the board creak this time. The sound of his own work masked it.

The first he knew was the lantern light flaring, amplified by a new source. A second light, harsh and yellow, flooded the corner from behind him.

Tilman froze, the mallet raised. The *tap* died in the air, unfinished.

“Now what,” a voice said, rough with phlegm and authority, “in the name of all that’s holy, do we have here?”

Slowly, Tilman lowered the mallet. He did not turn. He kept his gaze on the block, on the merchant’s accusing eyes, which now seemed to be staring past him at the intrusion.

“I asked you a question, dreamer.”

Tilman turned. Two men stood just inside the shed. One held a lantern high. The other, who had spoken, was a civic guard, his leather jerkin worn shiny at the shoulders, a short, heavy cudgel hanging from his belt. He was not one of the archbishop’s fine soldiers. He was a city watchman, a man who dealt with drunks and thieves and nuisances. His face was bored, irritated, deeply suspicious.

“This is private property,” Tilman said, his voice surprisingly steady. He gestured to the tools, the block. “I am a carpenter. I am working on a commission. The light is better here at night. My own workshop is too small.”

The watchman stepped forward, his boots crunching on the shavings. He peered at the block, his brow furrowed. “That’s no choir stall.” He squinted. “Is that… a building? Falling down?”

“An allegory,” Tilman said, the word slipping out before he could stop it. “For a private patron. A devotional piece. On the fall of pride.”

The watchman’s eyes narrowed. He was not an educated man, but he was not a fool. He smelled the lie, or at least the evasion. “A private patron. At this hour. In a stinking ruin.” He looked at Tilman’s hands, his fine tools, his good boots. “You don’t look like a man who needs to work in a midden. What’s your name? Where’s your shop?”

This was the precipice. To give his real name was to connect this secret block to his public life. To refuse was an admission of guilt.

“Tilman,” he said, deciding truth, selectively, was the only ground he had. “My workshop is on Schildergasse. You can check with the guild. I am a master carpenter.”

“Schildergasse,” the watchman echoed, his tone implying the distance between that respectable street and this foul shed was a moral chasm. “And this patron? His name?”

“He wishes anonymity. It is a sensitive subject. A meditation on his own… spiritual failings.” Tilman forced himself to meet the watchman’s gaze. He poured every ounce of his weariness, his artisan’s pride, his desire to be left alone, into that look. “I am merely the carver. I translate his piety into wood.”

The watchman stared at him for a long, tense moment. He looked at the exquisite detail of the carving, the obvious skill. It argued for legitimacy. A man doing something illicit would not take such painstaking care. Yet the location screamed of secrecy.

“An allegory,” the watchman muttered again. He reached out a dirty finger, as if to touch the merchant’s face.

“Please,” Tilman said, a sharp note of genuine panic entering his voice. “The oils from your hand… it could ruin the block. Months of work.”

The watchman withdrew his hand, scowling. The sanctity of craft had registered. He looked at his companion, who shrugged, indifferent.

“Alright, Master Carpenter of Schildergasse,” the watchman said, stepping back. “You finish your… meditation. But not here. This is a dumping ground, not a workshop. I see you here again, I’ll run you in for trespass and suspicion. And I’ll be paying a visit to your shop on Schildergasse to have a word with this shy patron of yours. Understood?”

Tilman nodded, his throat tight. “Understood. I will be gone by morning.”

“See that you are.”

The two men turned, their light receding, leaving Tilman once more in the solitary blade of his own lantern. He listened to their footsteps fade, to the board settling back into place. Then his knees gave way. He sat heavily on the stone, his heart hammering against his ribs so violently he thought it might crack them.

It was over. The shed was burned. The watchman would remember. He might still come to the shop. The narrowest of escapes, but an escape that had left a trail.

He looked at the block. It was ninety percent complete. Only the broad sky remained to be cleared. He could not finish it here. He had until dawn.

With hands that now shook, he wrapped the block tightly. He gathered his tools. He scattered the fresh shavings over the ash pile, erasing the evidence of his work. He extinguished the lantern.

He slipped out into the night, a fugitive with a heavy, unfinished sin in his arms. The tower was carved. But it was mute. It could not speak without the press. And the press was in Werner’s cellar, a world away, across a city that now felt like a field of watchful eyes. He had the key, but he had lost the door. The labour was done. Now came the infinitely more dangerous task: the delivery.

# Chapter 16

## **Chapter 16**

The city held its breath in the hour before dawn, a damp, grey suspension between the dissolution of night and the arrival of day. The air in the streets was a broth of river-fog and chimney-smoke, thick enough to drink, and it clung to Tilman’s skin as he moved through it, a ghost burdened with solid weight. The block, wrapped in sackcloth and cradled in his arms like a sleeping child, was a cold, dense core of gravity around which his world now turned. He felt its mass in the ache of his shoulders, in the tremor of his exhausted arms. It was no longer a promise, but an accusation. He had given it form, and in doing so, had made it a thing that could be seized, broken, used as evidence.

He kept to the alleys that ran like neglected seams behind the grander avenues, his progress a series of pauses and darting movements. Every sound—the scuttle of a rat in a midden, the groan of a shutter being secured from within, the distant, hollow call of the *Büttel* on the outer walls declaring the fifth hour—was a potential lunge from the darkness. The watchman’s threat was a hook in his mind, dragging behind his thoughts. *A visit to your shop on Schildergasse.* It was not an if, but a when. The man’s professional irritation would fester into curiosity by the light of day. Tilman’s workshop, his sanctuary, was now a marked place.

He reached the rear of his own premises as the sky began its subtle shift from ink to charcoal. The familiar, warped door to his yard, its oak swollen with damp, seemed alien. He set the block down with a reverence that felt foolish, fumbled the heavy iron key from his belt, and let himself into the cramped, cobbled space. The smell of cut wood and linseed oil, usually a comfort, was now the scent of a trap. He barred the door behind him and stood for a long moment in the silence, listening to the thud of his own heart.

He could not stay. He knew this with a clarity that was almost peaceful. The workbench, the ranked chisels, the patient dust motes dancing in the coming light—they belonged to a man who no longer existed. That man had been a craftsman with a secret. He was now a fugitive with a finished sin. The distinction was everything.

Inside, the shop was a museum of his former life. He moved through it not as its master, but as a thief. He took a large, waxed canvas satchel used for transporting unfinished panels, emptied it of its wood scraps, and laid the wrapped block inside. It was a tight fit, the canvas straining. He added his smallest, sharpest finishing tools, a roll of lamb’s wool for packing, a stoppered jar of walnut oil. His hands moved with a methodical haste, the trained motions of craft applied to dismantling his own existence.

From a hidden compartment beneath a floorboard—a modification he had made years ago, a laughable precaution for a man who dealt in nothing more subversive than altarpieces and dowry chests—he retrieved a small leather purse. It held his accumulated margin, the difference between survival and ruin over a decade of work. The coins were few, but they were his. He tied the purse inside his tunic.

The rest was inventory. Wood. Glue. Pigments. The tools of his trade were his identity, and to leave them was a kind of death. He selected three chisels—the skew, the fishtail, the fine veiner—and a small, brass-headed mallet. These he could not abandon. They were extensions of his will. He wrapped them in a cloth and placed them in the satchel beside the block.

A noise from the street outside—the clatter of a cart, too early for the usual deliveries—froze him. He stood in the centre of the room, a statue of listening. The sound passed. He released a breath he had not known he was holding.

He could not go to Werner’s cellar now. The watch would be changing, the city stirring. A man carrying a suspiciously heavy satchel would be noted. He needed a hole to crawl into, a place to wait out the searching eye of day. He thought of the cathedral yard, of the perpetual shadow of the south tower where beggars and pilgrims huddled, but it was too open, too watched. He thought of the river wharves, the labyrinth of stacked timber and tarpaulins, but the river-men were a closed tribe, suspicious of outsiders.

Then he remembered the leper’s gate.

It was a small, arched postern in the old Roman wall, long since bricked up, on the eastern fringe of the city where the tanners and fullers worked. The stench of their vats and urine pits was a shield against the respectable. Just before it, tucked into the angle of the wall, was the shell of a lime-burner’s hut, its roof collapsed, its walls stained white by decades of chemical smoke. It was a place of utter desolation, avoided by all. It was perfect.

He shouldered the satchel. The weight was immense, a physical truth he had to accept. He took one last look at the workshop. The half-carved head of a saint stared blankly from a bench, its features smoothed by his own hand into a serene emptiness. He blew out the single tallow candle, plunging the room into a grey, formless gloom, and slipped out the back door into the dawn.

***

The journey across the city was a descent. From the respectable, gabled order of Schildergasse, he moved into the tangled, stinking warrens of the *Fleischgasse*, where butchers’ offal clogged the central gutter, then into the marshy, low-lying districts where the tanners held sway. The fog here was different, warmer, carrying the sweet-rot reek of curing hides and the eye-watering bite of lye. The few people he passed were shapeless in the murk, their faces wrapped against the miasma. They did not look at him. Here, a man’s business was his own, provided it did not interfere with the vats.

He found the hut. It was worse than he remembered. One wall had slumped inward, and the floor was a cake of hardened lime and debris. But the rear corner, where two walls still met, was dry and sheltered by a remnant of roof. He cleared the worst of the rubble with his foot, the scraping loud in the absolute silence of the place. Even the flies seemed to avoid it.

He set the satchel down with a grunt of relief and sank against the cold wall. The exhaustion he had held at bay with fear and purpose now flooded him, a tide of lead in his veins. His eyes burned. His hands, curled from hours of gripping chisels, ached with a deep, bony pain. He wanted nothing more than to sleep, to let the oblivion of it wash over him and carry him away from the block, from the watchman, from the terrible, unfinished task that lay ahead.

But sleep was a luxury for the innocent. He was a man with a key to a cellar that might as well be on the moon. He had to think. The watchman would come to the shop. He would find it empty, tools cold, work abandoned. What would he conclude? That the guilty carpenter had fled. He would ask after Tilman in the neighbourhood. Old Liese might mutter about dreamers. His few clients would express bafflement. The search would be cursory, perhaps. A missing craftsman was not a riot, not a murder. He might be forgotten, absorbed into the city’s vast, indifferent ledger of the missing.

But the block changed the calculus. It was not a man that was missing, but a thing. A specific, dangerous, heretical thing. If the watchman connected the strange, solitary figure in the dumping ground to the missing carpenter, and if he had a mind to pursue it… Tilman’s name could be circulated. A description. His profession.

He had to assume the worst. He could not be Tilman the carpenter any longer.

The thought was a cold void. His name, his craft—they were the twin pillars upon which his thirty years of life had been built. To strip them away was to become nothing, a vapour in the foul air. He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, seeing bright, chaotic patterns against the darkness. What was left? The seeking. The stubborn, stupid, undeniable need to ask the question the block now posed. It was the only thread he had to hold. It was pulling him into the abyss, but it was all he had.

He must get to Werner’s cellar. Tonight. It was the only move left on the board. He had the key. He had the block. He needed the press. The three elements, brought together, would complete the act. And then? He did not know. The question of what came after the printing was a luxury as distant as sleep.

The day wore on, measured not by the sun, which never penetrated the foul blanket of the tanneries’ smoke, but by the changing timbre of the sounds outside. The slap of hides being worked. The calls of the labourers. The distant bells of the city marking the canonical hours—Terce, Sext, Nones—their familiar tones distorted and muted by distance and vapour. He drank a little water from a skin he had filled at a public fountain miles away. He ate a piece of hard, stale bread. He did not unwrap the block. To look at it here, in this defiled place, felt like a further sacrilege.

Instead, he took out the three chisels and his sharpening stone. He spat on the stone’s surface and began to draw the steel across it in long, practised strokes. The rhythmic *shush-shush-shush* was a meditation. It required no thought, only attention. He focused on the angle of the blade, the even pressure of his fingers, the gradual formation of a burr on the metal’s edge. This was a truth he understood. Dull tools lied. They tore where they should cut, they blurred where they should define. They made the hand doubt itself. As he worked, the world narrowed to the line of the edge, the sound of the stone, the feel of the steel. His fear receded, not gone, but held at bay by the simple, physical certainty of the task.

He was honing the fishtail chisel when the new sound came.

It was not from the tanneries. It was closer. A soft, shuffling step, followed by a pause. Then another. Someone was moving through the rubble outside the hut, with the hesitant care of the old or the infirm.

Tilman froze, the chisel poised above the stone. His breath stopped. He willed himself to become part of the wall, to fade into the lime-stained brick.

A shape filled the broken doorway, blotting out the grey light. It was a man, shrouded in a cloak of coarse, undyed wool, its hood drawn up. He stood perfectly still, as if listening or sniffing the air. Tilman could see no face, only a shadow within the hood.

“The air is purer inside,” the figure said. His voice was dry, papery, without accent or emotion. It was the voice of a man who had little use for conversation.

Tilman said nothing. His hand tightened on the chisel. It was a tool, not a weapon, but in that moment, the distinction was meaningless.

The man took a slow step into the hut. He moved with a strange, stiff grace, avoiding the larger piles of debris without seeming to look at them. “You need not fear me. I am not the watch. I am a fellow tenant of the forgotten places.”

“This place is taken,” Tilman said, his own voice rough from disuse.

“So I see.” The man’s hood tilted slightly, taking in the satchel, the sharpening stone, Tilman’s own travel-stained clothes. “You are a man between stations. A pilgrim without a shrine.”

The words were too close to the truth. They prickled on Tilman’s skin. “What do you want?”

“A moment’s respite from the stench. The same as you.” The man leaned against the opposite wall, a careful, deliberate motion. He did not push back his hood. “You work with wood. I can smell it on you. The resin. The oil. And something else… the scent of fresh-cut applewood. A rare choice. Holds fine detail, but prone to warping. A wood for a specific, delicate purpose.”

A chill that had nothing to do with the damp crawled down Tilman’s spine. This was no chance encounter. “Who are you?”

“A collector of curiosities. Of questions made manifest.” The man reached into his cloak and drew out a small object. He held it up in the dim light. It was a woodcut, printed on a ragged scrap of paper. The image was crude, frenzied: a many-tongued beast with a papal tiara, devouring peasants. The kind of seditious filth that was nailed to church doors in the dead of night. “The word, made flesh. Or at least, made ink. A powerful magic, is it not? To duplicate a thought, an accusation, a vision… to let it walk abroad on a hundred legs, into a hundred minds.”

Tilman stared at the paper. His mouth was dry. “I have nothing to do with that.”

“Of course not. That is gutter work. Hurried. Fearful. Its lines are screams.” The man tucked the paper away. “The work I smell on you is different. It is slow. It is contemplation given grain. It is a question carved, not shouted.” He paused. “The watchman on the western dump was most intrigued. A man communing with a block of wood in the middle of the night. He spoke of it at the change of watch. A curiosity. I collect curiosities.”

The world seemed to tilt. The watchman had talked. And this man had listened. He was not authority, but something else—a creature who moved in the spaces between authority and the underworld, feeding on information.

“What do you want from me?” Tilman asked again, the chisel a cold, hard line in his palm.

“The curiosity. I wish to see it.”

“No.”

“A man who has fled his workshop, who hides in a lime-burner’s hut with his most precious tools, is not in a position to refuse polite requests.” The man’s voice remained mild, almost bored. “I am not here to seize it. I am here to appreciate it. There is a difference. One is theft. The other is… communion.”

Tilman’s mind raced, a rat in a corner. This man knew of the watchman. He knew of the shop. He had tracked him here. He was a predator. To show him the block was to give him everything. But to refuse him… what would he do? Raise an alarm? Fetch the watch himself?

“If I show you,” Tilman said slowly, “you leave. And you forget where you saw it.”

The hood dipped in a nod. “A fair trade. For now.”

The ‘for now’ hung in the toxic air. Tilman knew it was a devil’s bargain. But he saw no other path. He set the chisel down carefully, its edge gleaming dully. He knelt, his body protesting, and drew the satchel toward him. His fingers fumbled with the ties. He pulled back the canvas, then the layer of sackcloth beneath.

The block lay exposed in the gloom.

The carved cityscape, the towering, impossible steeple, seemed to drink the weak light. The intricate web of its stonework, the minute, desperate figures, the sheer vertiginous scale of it—it was a world in negative, a universe of shadows waiting to be filled with light. In this foul hut, it looked like a relic fallen from heaven into a midden.

The shrouded man did not move for a long time. He simply looked. Then, he took one step closer, then another. He bent at the waist, a stiff, careful movement, bringing his hooded face within a foot of the wood. Tilman could hear his breathing now, a soft, rhythmic intake.

“Ah,” the man breathed. The sound was one of genuine, profound recognition. “It is not an accusation. It is a ladder.”

He straightened. The shadow within the hood seemed to deepen. “You seek to climb out of the world.”

“I seek to see it from above,” Tilman whispered, the words torn from him.

“It is the same thing.” The man was silent again, his gaze fixed on the block. “This is not for the rabble. This is not a polemic. This is a private heresy. The most dangerous kind.” He turned his hidden face toward Tilman. “You intend to print it.”

“I must.”

“Of course you must. A ladder is not meant to be looked at. It is meant to be climbed.” The man took a slow step back. “The watchman will come for you. He is a dull tool, but persistent. He will follow the grain of your life until it leads him to you. You have until tomorrow, perhaps the next day.”

“I know.”

“The cellar under the house of the late Master Werner, the printer. It is still sealed. The press is there.” The man said it as a simple statement of fact.

Tilman’s blood turned to ice. He said nothing.

“A key is a small thing to track,” the man continued, his tone conversational. “Especially when a man asks after a specific lock in a specific, disgraced house. The locksmith on Am Hof is a friend of mine. He remembered a carpenter, troubled, seeking a duplicate for a lock long unused.” He gave a soft, rustling sigh. “You leave a trail, dreamer. Like a snail in salt.”

Despair, cold and final, closed around Tilman’s heart. He was transparent. He was already caught. He had merely not yet been handed over.

“Why are you telling me this?” he asked, his voice hollow.

“Because I wish to see the ladder climbed.” The man turned and began to walk toward the doorway. “I will divert the watchman. For a day. I will send him chasing a rumour of a Lutheran woodcutter in the fishing village of Deutz. It will amuse me.” He paused at the threshold. “You have one night. Tonight. Use it. Print your ladder. Then burn it. Burn it utterly. The block, the paper, everything. What you carry in your mind after that is your own affair. But the physical evidence… it is a millstone. It will drag you under.”

“Who are you?” Tilman asked for the third time, the question now a plea.

The figure in the doorway was a silhouette against the bruised daylight. “I am a man who believes questions are more interesting than answers. And your block… it is the most beautiful question I have ever seen. Do not let the answerers get their hands on it. They will only break it, and use the pieces to build a prison.”

And then he was gone, his shuffling footsteps fading quickly into the ambient rumble of the tanneries.

Tilman remained on his knees, staring at the empty doorway. The encounter had the quality of a fever-dream. Had it happened? The block lay before him, real and solid. The man’s words echoed in the silent hut. *One night.*

The gift of a day’s grace, from a phantom. The price: to destroy the work after it was born.

He rewrapped the block with trembling hands, his mind a whirlwind. It was a trap. It had to be. A way to ensure he went to the cellar, where he could be taken. But the man had known everything already. He could have taken him now, or brought the watch. He had not.

*I wish to see the ladder climbed.*

Tilman believed him. In that moment, he believed the strange, shrouded man was a fellow seeker, a connoisseur of perilous truths. He was offering a pact: a chance to complete the act, in exchange for its annihilation. It was a devil’s bargain, but it was the only bargain on the table.

He tied the satchel shut. The weight was the same, but it felt different. It was no longer just his burden. It was now a shared secret. A watched experiment.

He had until nightfall. Then he would have to walk through a city that might already have his description, to a cellar that might be watched, to perform an act that would end in fire.

The seeking had led him here, to a lime-burner’s hut, receiving instructions from a ghost. The path did not grow clearer. It only grew more strange, and more narrow. There was no turning back. There was only the next step, the next breath, the next movement toward the dark mouth of Werner’s cellar.

The day’s last light bled away, replaced by a deeper, more profound gloom. The sounds of the tanneries ceased. The city prepared for night. Tilman stood, hefting the satchel. The ladder was carved. The press waited. The phantom had given him a night.

He stepped out of the hut and into the gathering dark, a man walking toward a promised conflagration.

# Chapter 17

## **Chapter 17**

The dark that gathered over Cologne was not the clean, star-pricked dark of the countryside. It was a substance, a slow seep of shadow from the river and the alleyways and the thousand unvented hearths, thickening the air with the smell of damp stone, cold ash, and the distant, metallic tang of the tanneries. Tilman moved through it like a swimmer through a turgid stream, the satchel a familiar, terrible weight against his hip. The phantom’s gift—the single night—was a lens that sharpened every sense. The cobbles were not just stones underfoot; they were a topography of peril, each crack a potential snare, each slick patch a betrayal. The occasional glow from a shuttered window was not light, but a source of exposure, painting him in brief, guilty relief against the black.

He kept to the lesser arteries, the veins of the city where the buildings leaned close enough to whisper to one another across the filth of the gutters. The Hohe Straße, with its watchmen and its respectable, barred doors, was a world away. Here, the only law was the law of shadow, and the only witnesses were those who had a vested interest in blindness. He passed a pair of men huddled over a brazier, their faces hollowed by the low flame, their conversation a low mutter that ceased as he drew near. He felt their eyes on his back, not with recognition, but with the flat, assessing gaze of predators calculating risk and reward. He was not worth the trouble. He carried the look of a man already hunted, and there was no meat on such bones.

The seeking had brought him to this: a fugitive in his own life, navigating by memory and dread toward a destination that promised only consummation and then annihilation. The spiritual hunger that had driven him to carve the forbidden, to seek the press, had not been sated. It had been honed into a single, sharp point—the need to see the thing made real, just once, before the fire took it. The phantom had understood this. It was not mercy he had been offered, but a kind of cruel sacrament. A chance to hold the host on his tongue, to feel the divine burn, before the necessary purge.

He found the mouth of the alley that led to Werner’s cellar not by sight, but by the smell—the ghost of old ink, the sourness of damp paper, and beneath it, the mineral breath of the river seeping through ancient foundations. The alley was a slit in the city’s flesh, black and silent. Last time, he had crept. Now, he walked with a resigned directness. The time for stealth was past. The pact was in motion.

The cellar door was as he remembered: low, iron-banded, a slab of oak gone soft at the edges with rot. He laid a hand against it. The wood was cold, and slightly damp. He listened. From within, no sound of the press. No murmur of voices. Only the deep, waiting silence of a buried place.

He lifted the latch. It gave with a groan that seemed to tear the quiet of the alley wide open. He slipped inside, pulling the door shut behind him, sealing himself into the black.

For a long moment, he stood still, letting his breath settle, letting his eyes find the scant light. It came from a single, guttering tallow dip set on the edge of the great screw press. Its meager glow did not illuminate the cellar so much as carve islands of wavering form from the void: the monstrous, hunched shoulder of the press, the long table scarred with knife-cuts and ink-stains, the ranks of type cases like miniature, orderly graves. The air was a cold broth of old smoke, metal, and the earthy, fungal scent of paper stored below the ground.

“You are late.”

The voice came from the corner beyond the press, where the shadows were deepest. It was Werner’s voice, but stripped of its usual gruff pragmatism. It was thin, strained.

Tilman stepped forward, the satchel held before him like an offering. “I came as soon as I could.”

Werner emerged into the fringe of the light. The printer looked aged. His broad shoulders were hunched, his face a landscape of new crevices carved by worry. His eyes, usually sharp with cunning or irritation, were wide and restless, flicking from Tilman to the cellar door and back. “The city is uneasy. The Archbishop’s men are not just at the gates. They are in the taverns. They are buying drinks for gossips. They are asking after strange wood, and strange men who ask after presses.” He wiped a hand over his mouth. “They have a description. Not a good one. But it is enough to make a man nervous.”

“They have not come here,” Tilman said, more to steady himself than the printer.

“Not yet.” Werner’s gaze fixed on the satchel. “You have it? The whole thing?”

“I have it.”

“And you are resolved? To print it? To… do what must be done after?”

The phantom’s instruction. *Destroy it.* “I am resolved.”

Werner nodded, a quick, jerky motion. “Good. Then we waste no more of the night. The night is not our friend. It is simply the time we have been given.” He moved to the press, his hands running over the great screw, the platen, a mechanic’s reassuring touch. “The paper is damped. The ink is mixed. I have set the chase for your page. We need only lock your block in place.”

Tilman approached the table. Laid out upon it was the imposing stone, the heavy iron chase, the wooden furniture and quoins. Within the chase, the empty space waited—a perfect rectangle of negative potential. He untied the satchel and drew out the wrapped block. The linen fell away. The carved wood seemed to drink the frail light, the intricate lines of text and image—the ladder, the stars, the dense, heretical commentary—becoming a network of deep, black grooves.

Werner drew in a sharp breath. He had seen the first block, the simple ladder. This was different. This was a forest of meaning, a dense thicket of thought given form. He reached out a calloused finger, but did not touch it. “It is… a mighty thing,” he whispered, and there was fear in his awe. “A mighty, dangerous thing.”

Together, they worked in a silence broken only by the tap of the mallet, the scrape of wood and metal. Tilman laid the block face-up in the bed of the press. Werner packed the furniture around it, driving the quoins tight until the block was imprisoned, immovable. It was a form of burial. The block was sealed in its iron coffin, ready to give birth.

Werner inked the ball. The sticky, pungent black spread over the taut leather. He worked with a fierce, concentrated rhythm, dabbing and rolling, dabbing and rolling, until the carved surface was a gleaming, uniform velvet. Each pass of the roller was an incantation. The block was no longer just wood. It was a vessel being filled.

They lifted the damp sheet of paper together, the linen-fine sheet gossamer in their hands. They positioned it over the chase, the silence now so profound Tilman could hear the faint sigh of the paper settling. Werner nodded. Tilman stepped to the lever.

This was the moment. The seeking, the theft, the carving in stolen hours, the flight, the phantom—all of it narrowed to this single, physical act. He took the cold iron of the lever in both hands. He pulled.

The great screw turned with a low, wooden protest. The platen descended. There was no dramatic sound, only a firm, final pressure, the quiet sigh of paper accepting ink. He held it for a count of three, his muscles trembling not from strain, but from the enormity of the transfer. Truth, passing from one substance to another.

He released the lever. The screw groaned upward. Werner, with a delicacy that belied his thick fingers, peeled the corner of the sheet back.

They both leaned in.

There, black on white, damp and perfect, was the image. It was sharper, clearer, more alive than the block itself. The ink gave it depth, a startling immediacy. The ladder seemed to rise from the page. The stars were not just shapes; they were apertures. The text, his small, painstaking lettering, was a legion of tiny, black soldiers marching in perfect, terrifying order. It was complete. It was whole. It was a thought, made flesh.

A shudder passed through Tilman, a convulsion of something that was neither joy nor terror, but a pure, uncut essence of both. He had climbed the ladder in his mind. Now he held the proof in the world.

Werner exhaled, a long, trembling stream of air. “God have mercy,” he murmured, not as a curse, but as a genuine, bewildered prayer.

They printed the rest of the run. Fifty sheets. Each pull of the lever was a repetition of the sacrament, each peeled sheet a new birth. The pile of perfect, dangerous pages grew on the side table. The rhythm became mechanical, hypnotic. The fear receded, replaced by the trance of the work. The cellar existed only as the circle of light around the press, the smell of ink, the soft *thump* of the platen meeting paper.

When the last sheet was laid upon the pile, the silence rushed back in, louder than before. The deed was done. The block, its purpose fulfilled, sat stained and smeared in the chase.

Werner was the first to break the spell. He moved to the small, brick-lined hearth where a low fire was kept for warming ink. “The agreement,” he said, his voice rough. He did not look at Tilman.

Tilman stared at the pile of fifty truths. They were warm, slightly damp. They were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. The phantom’s instruction was a cold stone in his gut. *Destroy it.* He had agreed. The pact was the only reason he stood here, unharmed.

He picked up the first sheet. The ink shimmered. He walked to the fire. He held the corner to the flame.

It caught quickly, the paper blackening, curling, the text consumed mid-sentence, the ladder twisting into a wraith of ash. He dropped it into the hearth. The flame leapt, hungry. He took the next sheet, and the next. He fed the fire with his children. Each sheet hissed as it died, a brief, bright protest, then nothing. The cellar filled with the sweet, acrid smell of burning paper and ink. Werner turned away, busying himself with cleaning the ink ball, scrubbing with a ferocity that spoke of his need to not witness the auto-da-fé.

Tilman’s hand was steady. He felt nothing. He was a hollow man performing a necessary rite. The seeking was over. This was the end of the path: a pile of ash, a stained block, and the memory of a thing that had been, for one moment, real.

He burned forty-nine sheets.

The fiftieth lay on the table, separate from the pile. He had not placed it there. He looked at Werner. The printer’s back was to him, his shoulders rigid.

Tilman understood. A connoisseur of perilous truths. Not just the phantom. Werner, too. The printer had risked his neck for more than coin. He had wanted to see it, too. To hold a fragment of the forbidden knowledge, not to spread, but to own. A private heresy.

He did not reach for it. He let it lie. He turned to the chase, to the final part of the bargain. Using a pry, he worked the quoins loose. He lifted the block from its iron bed. The carved surface was a mess of black, the fine lines clogged with drying ink. It was a corpse.

He carried it to the hearth. The fire, fattened on paper, was roaring now. He did not hesitate. He laid the block upon the flames.

The wood did not catch at once. It smoked, a thick, resinous smoke that stung the eyes. Then, with a soft *whump*, the fire embraced it. The flames licked along the grain, finding the deep-cut letters, the delicate rungs of the ladder. They began to dance in the grooves, tracing the text with light before consuming it. The block warped. A loud crack split the air as the wood, under tension from its carving, gave way. It was not a destruction; it was an unraveling. The thought was being unwritten, line by line, in fire.

Tilman watched until his eyes watered from the heat and the smoke. Until the block was a shapeless, blackened mass collapsing into embers. It was done.

The cellar was different. It was just a cellar again. A place of business. The magic had been spent, the sacrament concluded, the evidence purged. All but one silent, damning sheet on a table.

Werner finally turned. His face was slick with sweat and soot. He looked at the empty chase, the dying fire, the single remaining sheet. He said nothing. He simply walked to the table, took the sheet, and, with immense care, rolled it into a tight cylinder. He slipped it inside a hollowed-out length of firewood from the stack by the hearth.

“You should go,” Werner said, his voice a dry husk. “The night is old. The phantom… he said one night. He did not say it ended at dawn.”

Tilman nodded. The satchel was empty. His hands were stained with ink and soot. He felt weightless, and utterly spent. The seeking had ended not in revelation, but in a void. He had climbed the ladder and found only the empty sky, and then he had burned the ladder.

He moved to the door. As he lifted the latch, Werner spoke again.

“The man who came. The one who gave you the night. He was not of the Archbishop. Nor of the town watch.”

Tilman paused. “How do you know?”

“Because men of power come with noise, with threats, with the clatter of authority,” Werner said, staring into the embers. “He came with silence. He knew things… about the craft. About the weight of a perfect impression. He spoke of your work not as a crime, but as a tragedy. He mourned its burning before it had even been printed.” The printer looked up, his eyes meeting Tilman’s in the gloom. “He is something else. A seeker, like you. But one who has reached the end of his own path, and now walks the length of others’, watching. Be careful of such men. Their understanding is a colder thing than any bishop’s wrath.”

Tilman stepped out into the alley. The air, foul as it was, felt clean and vast after the smoky tomb of the cellar. The sky was the color of a fresh bruise, the deepest hour before any hint of dawn. He had done it. He had fulfilled the pact. He was free. The block was ash. The sheets were ash.

But the knowledge was not. It was in his mind, indelible. And it was in Werner’s cellar, coiled inside a piece of firewood. And the phantom knew it. The phantom had *wanted* it this way. A single copy, surviving. A seed, buried.

He began to walk, his footsteps echoing in the empty lane. The spiritual seeking had transformed. It was no longer a hunger for an answer. It was the burden of an answer that could not be spoken, a truth that existed only in the spaces between its destruction and its secret preservation. He was not a heretic with a manifesto. He was a ghost, carrying the memory of a fire.

As he turned onto a slightly broader street, a shape detached itself from a doorway ahead. Not a phantom. A solid, broad-shouldered shape, capped with the distinctive, flared brim of a town watchman. The man was leaning against the wall, picking his teeth with a splinter. He looked up as Tilman approached. His eyes, dull with boredom, passed over him, then snapped back. They narrowed, focusing on Tilman’s hands, still darkly stained from the press and the hearth.

The watchman straightened up, slowly. He did not reach for his short sword. He did not call out. He simply took a single step forward, blocking the center of the street, his gaze fixed on the ink that would not wash away, the black testimony ground into the skin of a dreamer.

## **Chapter 18**

The watchman’s gaze was a physical pressure, a blunt instrument resting on the bridge of Tilman’s nose, then dropping to his hands. The street, a mere gully between overhanging eaves, held its breath. The only sound was the distant, perpetual drip from a broken gutter, marking time in the bruised air. Tilman felt the cold of the dawn seeping up from the cobbles, through his worn boots, into the marrow of his legs. He was a statue, caught mid-step, the phantom’s secret a hot coal in his mind and the watchman’s dull eyes a pail of cold water.

“You’re about early,” the watchman said. His voice was a gravelly thing, worn smooth by years of challenging drunks and chasing cutpurses. It held no particular suspicion, only the flat curiosity of a man whose night had been empty of incident.

Tilman’s own voice, when he found it, was a dry rustle. “The day starts early for some.”

“Aye. For bakers and butchers. For rat-catchers.” The man’s eyes never left Tilman’s hands. “Not for scribes.”

The word hung between them. It was an assumption, but a reasonable one. Who else had hands stained so, save a clerk, a copyist, a printer’s devil? Tilman’s mind was a blank page. Any lie would be an obvious scrawl. He offered a slow, stiff nod.

“I work for a printer. On the Witschgasse.” The truth, or a shard of it.

The watchman grunted, shifting his weight. He was a man built for standing in doorways, for filling space. “Witschgasse is that way.” He jerked a thumb over his shoulder, the opposite direction from which Tilman had come. “You’re a long way from your bed, scribe.”

“An errand. For my master.” The words tasted like ash. *My master is a ghost. My errand was to burn a book and bury its heart.*

“In the dark?” The watchman took one step closer. The smell of him arrived first—old sweat, wool grease, the faint, sour tang of cheap beer. His eyes were not intelligent, but they were thorough. They catalogued the frayed hem of Tilman’s cloak, the pallor of a man who worked by lamplight, the tension in his shoulders that spoke of something heavier than a delivery of broadsheets. “What manner of errand is done in the hour when honest folk are abed and thieves are finishing their work?”

Tilman’s freedom, so vast and clean a moment ago, had contracted to the width of this street, the span between himself and this bored, solid man. The spiritual seeking had ended in a secret kept. Now the keeping of it was its own fresh damnation. He had traded the bishop’s wrath for the watchman’s scrutiny, a colder, more intimate thing.

“A private matter,” Tilman said, and heard the weakness in it.

The watchman’s lips stretched into a thin, humorless line. He reached out, not with violence, but with a procedural inevitability, and took Tilman’s right wrist. His grip was like iron shackles, warm and implacable. He turned the hand over, exposing the palm to the grey light. The stains were not just on the fingers; they were ground into the whorls of the skin, a permanent map of his night’s labour. Black from the ink-ball. Grey-brown from the ash of the fire.

“Private,” the watchman echoed. He rubbed his own thumb across Tilman’s palm, as if testing the quality of cloth. The stain did not smudge; it was part of him now. “This isn’t fresh work. This is a week’s worth of sin, ground in. And this…” He brought Tilman’s hand closer to his face, sniffed. “Smoke. Not hearth smoke. The sharp smell of paper and old glue burning. The smell of a heretic’s breakfast.”

He released the wrist. Tilman’s arm fell to his side, heavy and alien. The watchman did not step back. He was blocking the way, a wall of municipal authority.

“I’ve seen hands like this before,” the man said, almost conversationally. “Last autumn, after they cleared out that nest of Anabaptists from the cellar under the tanner’s yard. Their pamphleteer had hands like old parchment, black and crackled. They burned his stock. They burned his press.” He tilted his head. “They let him go, with a warning. A foolish mercy. Words are like rats, scribe. You think you’ve killed the litter, but there’s always one that gets into the walls, to breed.”

Tilman said nothing. The phantom’s design was a perfect, terrible mechanism. The watchman was not a villain, not an agent of some grand inquisition. He was a simple gear in the city’s clockwork, turning, encountering an irregularity. His understanding was limited, but it was accurate. He saw a man with a printer’s hands, smelling of a suspicious fire, abroad in the forbidden hours. He did not need to know about the *Theologia Germanica* or the phantom’s cold hunger. This was enough.

“Your name,” the watchman said. It was not a question.

“Tilman. Of Mainz.”

“Your master’s name on the Witschgasse.”

Here, the truth would be a rope. “Werner,” he said, the name like a stone in his throat. To give it was to point this man, with his dull, persistent eyes, toward the cellar, toward the hidden log. It was a betrayal. But the alternative was to be dragged to the watch-house now, where questions would be sharper, and the connection to Werner would be uncovered anyway, with more violence.

The watchman committed it to memory, his lips moving silently. “Werner. On the Witschgasse.” He nodded, finally stepping aside, but only just. The path was narrow. “Go home, Tilman of Mainz. Wash your hands. If that stain does not come out, it is because the sin is in deeper than the skin. I will remember your face. And I will speak to this Werner. A master is responsible for his devil. If his devil is lighting fires before dawn, the city wants to know why.”

It was a dismissal, but it was a sentence, too. A postponement. The threat was not in immediate arrest, but in the memory of his face, in the promise of a conversation. The watchman would come. It might be today, it might be in a week. But he would come, with his questions and his dull, thorough gaze, and he would look at Werner’s press, and at his firewood.

Tilman walked past him. The space between the watchman’s body and the damp wall felt like a gauntlet. He expected a hand on his shoulder at any moment, the game reversed. But it did not come. He walked, forcing his steps to be even, measured, until he turned the corner at the end of the street. Only then did the breath he had been holding shudder out of him, and a violent, helpless tremor took his hands. He stared at them, the blackened proof. The watchman was wrong. The sin was not in the stain. The sin was in the knowledge the stain represented, and in the act of its preservation. He had become a keeper of a forbidden truth, and the world, in the form of a bored man with bad teeth, had taken note.

He did not go to the Witschgasse. He wandered, a ghost in the growing light, as the city began to stir. Shutters creaked open. The first servants appeared with buckets for the wells. A cart laden with cabbages rumbled past, the driver hunched and miserable. Tilman moved among them, invisible in his plain cloak, yet feeling as conspicuous as a leper. His freedom was a phantom itself. He had escaped the letter of his pact with the phantom, but he was now bound by its consequences. The spiritual seeking had promised a transcendent truth. It had delivered, instead, a secret so heavy it bent his spine, and a witness.

He found himself by the river. The Rhine was a broad, muscular grey, sliding past the city with a silent, indifferent power. The mist was lifting, tearing into ragged shrouds that caught on the masts of the few boats already moored at the quay. He stood on the slick stones, watching the water. To throw the log in would be the final, logical act. To let the river have the seed. It would be carried to the sea, waterlogged, lost. The phantom’s design, thwarted. His own conscience, cleared.

But he did not move. The phantom had chosen him not for his strength, but for his hunger. And the hunger had been fed, and had changed its nature. It was no longer a yearning for light, but a responsibility to it. To destroy the log now would not be an act of piety. It would be an act of fear. The watchman’s fear. The bishop’s fear. It would mean the phantom had won, not by preserving the text, but by revealing to Tilman the true cost of truth, and finding him wanting.

He turned from the river, his mind a turmoil of cold clarity. He could not go to Werner’s. He could not go to his own sparse room. He was a vector of danger. He needed to see the one person whose understanding was, as the printer had warned, a colder thing. The one person who had perhaps foreseen this very moment.

He found the street of the leaning houses as the first true sunlight, weak and watery, breached the cloud-cover. The place seemed less a refuge in the dawn, more a forgotten crevice. He descended the steps to the phantom’s door. He did not knock with the desperate rhythm of before. He struck the wood once, firmly.

There was a long silence. Then the sound of the bolt, smooth and well-oiled. The door opened not a crack, but fully. The phantom stood there. He was dressed, as if he had not slept, in a simple dark robe. His face was not pale with night-time mystery, but looked tired, lined, the face of an old scholar who had read too much by poor light. His eyes held no surprise.

“You are back sooner than I anticipated,” he said. His voice was quiet, stripped of its earlier theatrical resonance. “The watchman, I presume.”

Tilman stepped inside, the familiar scent of dust and old paper closing around him. “You knew.”

“I calculated.” The phantom closed the door and gestured for Tilman to follow him into the main room. The books were silent sentinels. “A man leaving a place where a fire has consumed forbidden fruit, his hands marked by the tree and the flame, abroad in the hour when authority patrols out of boredom… it was a possible outcome. Not certain, but likely enough. I am sorry for it.”

The apology was so sterile, so intellectual, it sparked a hot coal of anger in Tilman’s chest. “Sorry? You orchestrated this. You wanted the book to survive. You used me to burn it and to hide it. You made me a carrier. And now the carrier is marked.”

The phantom settled behind his desk, steepling his fingers. “I did not make you anything, Tilman. I presented you with a choice. A paradox. To destroy a thing to save it. You chose to accept the terms. The consequences are part of the choice.”

“The consequence is that a town watchman will go to Werner. He will ask questions. He may find the log.”

“He may,” the phantom conceded. “If he is diligent, and if Werner is not clever. Werner is clever. But he is also afraid. Fear makes men either stupid or cunning. We shall see which he is.” He studied Tilman. “You are not here because of the danger to Werner. You are here because the burden has become personal. The abstract spiritual quest has become a practical problem of guilt and fear. This is the true education.”

Tilman leaned on the desk, his stained hands flat on the wood. “What do I do?”

“What do you wish to do?”

“I want the knowledge to be safe. I want…” He faltered. “I no longer know what I want. The wanting is gone. It has been replaced by a weight.”

The phantom nodded, a faint glimmer of something like approval in his eyes. “Good. The end of seeking is often not an answer, but a better understanding of the question. Or the realization that the question itself is a burden. You have graduated from a seeker to a guardian. It is a lonelier office.”

“A guardian of what? A piece of firewood?”

“Of the idea within it. An idea that has now survived two fires: the one you lit last night, and the one you are currently experiencing—the fire of scrutiny, of fear. It is being tempered.” The phantom opened a drawer and withdrew a small, plain pottery jar. He pushed it across the desk. “Walnut oil and pumice. It will not remove the stains, but it will fade them to the appearance of ordinary dirt. It will not pass a watchman’s close inspection, but it may allow you to pass through a crowd without notice.”

Tilman took the jar. It was a small mercy, practical and cynical. “And then?”

“And then you live. You avoid the Witschgasse. You find new work, if you can. You wait. The watchman may forget. He may be satisfied with Werner’s answers. Or he may not. If he does find the log, he will see only a piece of wood. He is not a seeker. He will not know to split it. The danger is not in the discovery of the object, but in the connection it creates between you, Werner, and a suspicious fire. The thread that leads here is more fragile. I am a ghost, remember.”

The plan was so passive, so reliant on chance and the limitations of others. It was not a plan at all; it was a strategy of endurance. Tilman felt the weight settle deeper. This was his victory: a life of waiting, of hiding in plain sight, of carrying a secret that was also a crime.

“You have what you wanted,” Tilman said, his voice hollow. “The book lives. I am its tomb.”

“No,” the phantom corrected softly. “You are its soil. For now, the seed is dormant. It may never sprout. But it exists. And you know it exists. In a world that burns truth, that is a form of victory. A cold one, but a victory nonetheless.”

Tilman left the house as the city fully woke around him. The sun was a pale coin behind the clouds. He went to the public well near his own lodgings and, with the gritty paste from the jar, scrubbed his hands until the skin was raw and red, the black fading to a shadow in the creases. They looked like the hands of a labourer now, a man who worked with earth and stone, not ink and ideas. The transformation was complete. He had entered the cellar a dreamer. He had left the phantom’s house a different kind of ghost: one that wore the guise of ordinary flesh.

He slept through the day in his rented closet, a leaden, dreamless sleep. When he woke, it was to dusk again. The cycle of his life had inverted. He was a creature of the margins now. He ventured out to buy bread and cheese from a stall he had never used before, avoiding his usual haunts. He ate in his room, listening to the sounds of the house—a child crying, a couple arguing, the mundane symphony of lives unburdened by secret fire.

For three days, he lived this way. A suspended animation. The spiritual seeking had been a flame, burning bright and consuming. Now he was embers, banked, giving no light, only a faint, lingering heat. He thought of the watchman’s slow walk to the Witschgasse. He thought of Werner’s face, pale in the cellar gloom, receiving the official questions. He thought of the pile of firewood, innocent and deadly.

On the fourth morning, a knock came at the door of his lodging house. It was not the thunder of authority, but the firm, regular rap of the landlady, Frau Gerber. Tilman’s heart clenched into a cold fist. He opened his door a crack.

Her face, usually a monument of mild disapproval, was puckered with genuine anxiety. “There is a man,” she whispered, her breath smelling of onions and worry. “For you. A printer, he says. He looks… unwell.”

Werner.

Tilman’s first instinct was to deny him, to send him away. But that would be a confession in itself. He nodded, pulling his tunic straight. “I will see him.”

He descended the narrow stairs to the front passage. Werner stood just inside the street door, hat in hand. He looked ravaged. His eyes were red-rimmed, his face the colour of old dough. The confident craftsman was gone, replaced by a man hunched around a core of pure terror.

“Tilman,” he breathed. He did not offer a greeting. “We must talk. Outside.”

They walked in silence for two streets, until Werner ducked into the alcove of a locked chapel doorway. He rounded on Tilman, his voice a desperate scrape.

“The watch came. Two days ago. A big man, with eyes like a dead fish. He asked for you. He described you. He asked about fires, about late work.” Werner’s hands were trembling. “I told him you had done some piecework for me, that you were unreliable, that I had dismissed you. I said I knew nothing of any fires. I showed him my press, my stock. He looked. He poked. He was… thorough.”

Tilman waited, the cold fist in his chest tightening.

“He went to the woodpile,” Werner said, the words barely audible. “He looked at it. He picked up a few pieces. He said a man who burns paper often needs a good fire afterwards.” Werner’s eyes were wide, unblinking. “He picked up *the log*. The one you showed me. He hefted it. He turned it over. He said, ‘This is good, dense wood. Burns long and hot.’ And then… he put it back. In a different place. On the top of the pile.”

The world tilted. The watchman had held it. He had seen it. He had *moved* it.

“He left,” Werner continued, a sob catching in his throat. “But he said he would return. To check on my ‘business practices.’ He is not satisfied. He knows I lied. He *knows*. And now… now I cannot bear it. The log. It sits there. It is a condemnation. Every time I look at the pile, I see it. It is a black spot. A poison.”

“What are you saying?” Tilman asked, though he already knew.

“It must be gone,” Werner hissed. “You must take it. Tonight. It is your burden. You brought it into my house. You have made me a part of this… this heresy. I have a family, Tilman! A business! I cannot have that thing under my roof, with that man coming back to look at it, to perhaps pick it up again and wonder why a simple printer keeps such a fine piece of oak for the fire.” He grasped Tilman’s arm, his grip feverish. “You must take it. Burn it properly. Throw it in the Rhine. I do not care. But remove the danger from my door.”

This was the collapse. The false victory shattered. He had thought the secret safe in its hiding place. He had thought Werner, clever and cautious, could withstand a simple watchman’s inquiry. But he had calculated without the corrosive power of fear. The phantom’s seed was not just hidden; it was active, a spiritual acid eating through the bonds of complicity, through courage, through reason. Werner was breaking, and in breaking, he was passing the lethal object back.

The watchman had not found it. But he had, by his mere attention, by his casual rearrangement of the woodpile, made it impossible for its guardian to endure. The phantom’s design was more profound than Tilman had understood. It did not rely on secrecy alone. It relied on the psychological weight of the secret, a weight not every man could bear. Werner had reached his limit.

“If I come for it,” Tilman said slowly, “and he is watching your house…”

“He is not watching it now! He came in the morning. He will not return for days, perhaps. Come tonight. Late. I will leave the cellar door unbarred. Take it and go. Never return to the Witschgasse. Never speak my name again.” Werner’s face was a mask of pleading and shame. “Please. You sought this truth. You must carry its cost.”

There was no argument to make. Werner was right. The burden was Tilman’s. The spiritual seeking had led him to this: not to enlightenment, but to a midnight theft of a piece of wood from a terrified man, under the imagined eye of the law. It was the lowest, most material expression of the sublime truth it contained.

He nodded. Werner’s relief was instantaneous, a physical sagging. He did not thank him. He simply turned and hurried away, disappearing into the flow of the street, eager to be rid of the ghost he had helped create.

Tilman stood in the chapel alcove, the stone cold against his back. The plan was set. He would become a thief in the night, reclaiming his own cursed treasure. The circle was closing, but not into completion. Into a tighter, more desperate coil. The watchman’s memory was a snare. Werner’s fear was a catalyst. The phantom’s seed was a lodestone, drawing all of them toward a conclusion that felt less like preservation, and more like a slow, inevitable conflagration.

He looked at his hands, the faint shadows of the stain still visible in the folds of skin. They were the hands of a guardian. And tonight, they would steal the very thing they were meant to protect, from the only safe haven it had ever known. The seeking was over. Now came the flight.

# Chapter 19

## **Chapter 19**

The bells of St. Martin’s marked the hours with a leaden, indifferent tone, their sound swallowed by the fog that had risen from the Rhine. It was a cold, woolen fog, thick enough to blunt the edges of the world and muffle the occasional footfall on the distant street. Tilman waited in the lee of a tanner’s shed, the air around him pungent with the ghost of alum and rotting flesh. He was a statue in the gloom, his breath a shallow, controlled rhythm. The seeking had distilled to this: a calculation of shadows, a listening for the watchman’s cough, a mapping of the route from this reeking alley to Werner’s cellar door.

He had spent the hours after leaving the chapel in a state of suspended animation. He had eaten without tasting, returned to his lodgings without seeing the stairs, packed a small sack with the few things he owned that mattered—a spare shirt, his carving knife, the dwindling coins sewn into his belt—as if preparing for a journey. He was. Whether he succeeded tonight or not, the Witschgasse was closed to him. Werner’s fear was a contagion, and the street itself had become a quarantine zone. His spiritual inquiry, his patient tracing of the phantom’s influence through the city’s soul, had collapsed into a single, physical objective. Retrieve the seed. Escape the geometry of the phantom’s design.

The last bell of the watch echoed, thin and final. Tilman moved.

He was a shadow among shadows, his dark cloak blending with the soot-stained walls. He avoided the main lanes, navigating instead a labyrinth of service alleys and shared courtyards, his path a silent, circuitous approach. The fog was his ally. It turned the occasional lantern into a blurred, sickly star, its light unable to penetrate more than a few feet. He crossed the Witschgasse at its northern end, a swift, fluid crossing from one pool of darkness to another. He saw no one. The houses were sealed, shutters tight against the damp and the night.

Werner’s house was a narrow, pinched structure squeezed between a cooper’s workshop and a taller merchant’s home. The cellar entrance was a low, arched door set three steps below street level, accessed from the alley that ran behind. Werner had been true to his word. The iron-banded door was not fully closed; a hair’s breadth of deeper black showed between it and the frame. No bar rested in its brackets.

Tilman paused, his ear close to the crack. Silence, and the cold, earthy smell of stored roots and damp stone. He placed his fingertips against the rough wood and pushed. The door swung inward without a sound. Werner had oiled the hinges.

The darkness within was absolute. Tilman stepped inside, pulling the door shut behind him until it rested as he had found it. He stood still, letting his eyes adjust, but there was nothing to adjust to. The blackness was a solid thing. He fumbled in his pouch for his flint and steel and the stub of a tallow candle. The strike was a shocking, violent spark in the void. The second sparked a flame, which he touched to the wick. A guttering, greasy light pushed back the dark, revealing a small, low-ceilinged cellar.

It was a space of mundane storage: sacks of grain, a barrel of salt, onions hanging in braids from the ceiling joists, their papery skins whispering in the draft from the door. The woodpile Werner had described was against the far wall, a neat, squared stack of split beech for the kitchen hearth. It looked ordinary. Innocent.

Tilman set the candle on an upturned crate. He approached the pile, his heart a dull, heavy knock against his ribs. This was not a moment for reverence, but for surgery. He began to remove the logs from the top layer, placing each one carefully, quietly on the earthen floor. The grain of the wood, pale and smooth in the candlelight, held no secret. He worked down to the second layer, then the third. His hands were steady, but a cold sweat traced his spine beneath his tunic.

He reached the fourth layer, the base. Here, the logs were thicker, older. His fingers, probing the space at the rear of the pile, brushed not against rounded wood, but against a corner. A right angle. He cleared the remaining logs away.

It was a single, unremarkable block of oak, darker than the beech, roughly the size of a large loaf of bread. It had been shoved to the back, disguised by the orderly rows in front of it. He lifted it. The weight was familiar, a dense, solemn gravity he had carried in his dreams. He did not need to see the stain to know it was the one. He could feel it, a subtle vibration in the grain, like the memory of a bell’s hum long after it has been struck.

He brushed the dirt from its surface. There, on one face, was the dark, cloud-like bloom, the phantom’s signature. It seemed to drink the candlelight, a pocket of deeper night in the already dark cellar. The sight of it, here in this hidden, fearful place, was both a relief and a profound desecration. He had found it. He had also confirmed its power to corrupt a sanctuary.

He was turning to place it in his sack when the candle flame shivered.

Not from a draft. From a footfall on the step outside.

The sound was soft, deliberate. Not the shuffling step of a sleepless householder, but the placed, cautious tread of someone who also moved in shadows. Tilman’s breath froze in his lungs. He snuffed the candle between his thumb and forefinger, the sizzle of the tallow lost in the sudden, crushing return of the dark. He dropped soundlessly to a crouch behind the bulk of the salt barrel, the block of oak clutched to his chest like a stolen child.

The cellar door creaked open.

A sliver of lesser darkness appeared, then widened. A figure stood silhouetted in the archway, not entering, simply observing. The fog swirled behind them. Tilman could make out no details, only a man’s shape, broad-shouldered, standing with a terrible, patient stillness. It was not Werner. The energy was all wrong. This was not fear, but assessment.

The figure took one step down, then another, entering the cellar. He left the door ajar. Tilman pressed himself against the cold, damp stone of the foundation wall. The man moved with a quiet confidence, as if he knew the space. His boots made soft, gritty sounds on the floor. He paused near where the candle had been. Tilman could hear him breathing, a slow, even rhythm.

A hand scraped against wood. The man was feeling the displaced logs of the pile.

A low, thoughtful hum vibrated in the man’s throat. It was not a sound of surprise, but of confirmation. He had expected to find the pile disturbed. He had come to check on it.

Werner’s terror had not been irrational. The phantom’s watchman was real, and his schedule was not so predictable as the cobbler had hoped. He was here now, in the middle of the night, performing his silent audit.

The man stood for a long minute in the center of the cellar. Tilman could feel the pressure of his gaze sweeping the darkness. He willed himself to be stone, to be part of the wall, to have no heartbeat. The block in his arms felt like it was glowing, screaming its presence into the silent dark.

Then, the boots shifted. They did not move toward the door. They took a single step in Tilman’s direction. Then another. The man was not leaving. He was investigating the corners.

He was going to find him.

Tilman’s mind, frozen in the ice of discovery, cracked. There was no plan. There was only the object in his arms and the man between him and the door. The spiritual seeking had ended in this cellar. What remained was animal.

As the man’s shape loomed closer, a hand reaching out toward the salt barrel, Tilman moved. He did not rise. He lunged forward from his crouch, leading with the block of oak. He swung it not as a bludgeon, but as a weight, a solid, shocking mass aimed at the man’s midsection.

It connected with a thick, muffled thud. The man grunted, the air driven from his lungs, and stumbled back a step. Tilman was already surging upward, using the momentum to shove past him, toward the door. His shoulder caught the man’s arm, spinning him. A hand clawed at Tilman’s cloak, catching a handful of wool. Tilman twisted, letting the cloak’s clasp give way. The fabric tore, and the man was left holding a rag of darkness as Tilman burst up the steps and into the alley.

The cold fog hit him like a wall. He did not look back. He ran, not with direction, but with the pure, frantic energy of a flushed hare. He heard a shout from the cellar, sharp and commanding, but it was swallowed by the fog. He plunged into the first intersecting passage, then the next, his feet slipping on the wet cobbles, the block of oak a clumsy, precious weight against his chest. He did not stop until the burn in his lungs was a fire and the silence behind him was total, broken only by the distant, mournful cry of a barge on the river.

He leaned against a wall, gasping, the rough stone scraping his cheek. He had it. He had escaped. But he had been seen. Not his face, perhaps, in the dark cellar, but his shape, his flight. The watchman knew the seed was gone, and he knew a thief had taken it. The phantom’s design had not been circumvented; it had been activated. The guardian had become a fugitive, and the pursuit would now begin in earnest.

He looked down at the block in his hands. The stain was invisible in the dark, but he knew it was there. It was no longer a relic to be contemplated. It was evidence. It was the cause. His flight was no longer a tactical retreat. It was a sentence. The city, with its fog and its bells and its countless, watching windows, was no longer a place of hidden truths. It was a cage, and every man in it a potential turnkey.

He had sought a spiritual truth and found a physical object. Now, he possessed the object, and the truth was this: he was alone, he was marked, and the only path left led away from everything he knew. The seeking was over. The running had just begun.

## **Chapter 20**

The world had narrowed to a single, pulsing point: the space between his shoulder blades. Tilman moved through the fog-shrouded warren of dockside alleys not as a man, but as a nerve, raw and exposed. Every echo of a dropped crate from the wharves was a footfall. Every drunkard’s cough from a tavern threshold was a signal. The block of oak, tucked inside his torn tunic, was no longer a weight against his chest but a brand, searing its irregular shape into his skin. He had traded a cloak for it. He had traded his anonymity. He had traded the quiet, scholarly pursuit of a mystery for the animal reality of the hunt.

He found a recess where two leaning timber buildings conspired to create a pocket of deeper shadow, a sliver of space that smelled of wet rot and old urine. He pressed into it, his back to the splintered wood, and tried to still his breathing. The cold air sawed in and out of his lungs. He listened. The city offered its usual nocturnal chorus: the distant lap of water against pilings, the creak of a sign swinging on its iron bracket, a fragment of song from a riverside tavern. No running feet. No shouted orders. The silence was not a comfort. It was the pause of a predator that has lost the scent, not abandoned the chase.

The phantom’s design. He saw it now with a terrible, clarifying simplicity. It was not a lock to be picked, but a snare to be sprung. The seed in its case was the bait. The watchman was the sprung jaw. And he, Tilman, had been the fool who reached in, thinking himself clever, thinking himself chosen. He was chosen. Chosen to be the quarry. The spiritual truth he had chased through manuscripts and half-remembered visions had crystallized into this base, physical law: possession was vulnerability. To hold the secret was to become the target.

He had to get off the streets. The watchman would raise an alarm, but of what nature? A theft from a forgotten cellar beneath a charnel house was not a matter for the city watch’s horn. This was a quieter, more specialized hunt. The phantom’s agents would be looking. Their methods would be those of the cellar: silence, shadow, efficient violence. He thought of the river, a black expanse just beyond the last row of warehouses. It was a cleaner end than whatever they might devise. The water would take the block, and him with it, and the secret would sink into the eternal mud.

The thought was a seductive whisper. It held the cold peace of finality. He let it sit for a moment, testing its weight. Then he pushed it away. It was not courage that moved him, but a deeper, more stubborn instinct. The seed was not just an object. It was a question he had asked with his whole life. To destroy it unexamined was to become nothing more than an erased footnote in the phantom’s ledger. He had to see it. He had to know what he had damned himself for.

He needed light. Shelter. A moment’s respite to look upon his damnation.

Memory provided an answer, a fragment from his earlier, gentler reconnaissance of the city’s forgotten places. The Church of the Minorites, near the riverbank, had been partially destroyed in a fire decades ago. Its nave was open to the sky, a skeletal ruin, but its undercroft—the burial vault—was said to be largely intact, sealed off and ignored. He had noted it as a potential hiding place for a man who wished to disappear from the world of the living. He had never imagined he would be that man.

He moved east, keeping to the thinnest alleys, his progress a series of darting pauses. The fog was his ally, clotting in the passages, swallowing sound and shape. He crossed broader streets at a crouching run, a fleeting stain against the greater stain of the night. The cold seeped through his damp clothes, a penetrating chill that reached for his bones. He welcomed it. It was a feeling, a proof of life.

The ruin rose out of the gloom like a broken tooth. One jagged wall stood against the sky, the outline of a great rose window gaping emptily. The rest was a tumble of blackened stone and charred timber, a hillock of despair. He circled to the river side, where the ground sloped down toward the water. There, half-buried in drifted refuse and wild ivy, was a low, arched doorway of soot-stained stone. The oak door that had once sealed it was gone, leaving only rusted iron hinges like skeletal hands. From the darkness within came the slow, metronomic drip of water and the smell of damp earth and old mortality.

Tilman hesitated on the threshold. To enter was to commit to the tomb. He glanced back the way he had come. The fog hung impassive. No shapes coalesced within it. He turned and ducked inside.

The darkness was absolute, a velvet pressure against his eyes. He stood still, letting his senses adjust. The drip of water was louder here, echoing in a space that felt vast and low-ceilinged. The air was still and frigid, carrying the mineral tang of stone and the faint, sweet-sour vestige of decay. He took a cautious step forward, his hands outstretched, his feet shuffling to avoid unseen obstacles. His fingers brushed rough-hewn wall. He followed it, moving slowly away from the entrance, deeper into the belly of the crypt.

After twenty paces, the wall turned a corner. Here, a faint, grey diffusion of light seeped in from the ruined nave above, filtering down through a collapsed section of the vaulting. It was not enough to see by, but it defined a space—a small, square chamber off the main passage. It was empty save for a thick carpet of dust and the bones of some small animal scattered in one corner.

This would have to do.

With trembling hands, he gathered a pile of dry splinters from a rotten timber that had fallen into the corner, and a handful of bone-dry ivy tendrils from the doorway. He had no tinderbox. He fumbled in the pouch still at his belt, his fingers finding the flint and steel he used for lighting his study lamp. The simple, familiar tools felt alien in this place of death. He knelt, struck a spark into the nest of tinder. A tiny glow, a wisp of smoke. He blew on it gently, his breath a prayer. The glow brightened, caught a tendril of ivy, and bloomed into a small, hungry flame.

He fed it carefully, adding larger splinters until he had a steady, if meager, fire. The light pushed back the darkness, revealing the low, vaulted ceiling of the chamber, the stones stained with centuries of smoke from forgotten candles. The shadows it cast were long and leaping, giving life to the walls.

He sat back on his heels, the fire between him and the entrance. Then, with the reverence of a priest handling a sacrament, he drew the block of oak from his tunic.

In the firelight, it was transformed.

In the cellar, it had been a shape of pure shadow. Now, it had substance. It was about the length of his hand from wrist to fingertip, and half as wide. The wood was dark, age-blackened oak, but the grain was still visible, swirling around the central, stained hollow like water around a drain. The stain itself was not a mere discoloration. It was a deep, resinous black, a tar-like substance that had been poured into the carved channel and had hardened there, capturing within it a scatter of tiny, granular particles that caught the firelight and glinted with a dull, metallic sheen. It was not beautiful. It was functional, potent, dense with intention. The carving was precise, the channel forming a series of interlocking, angular patterns that seemed to twist the eye if stared at too long. It was a language he did not know, written in geometry and alchemy.

This was no saint’s relic. No fragment of the True Cross held this aura of crafted purpose. This was a tool. A device. The “seed” was not a metaphor. It was the core of a mechanism. He ran a thumb along the edge of the stained channel. The wood was smooth, worn by countless other hands. How many guardians had held this? How many had died for it?

A sound.

Not from the entrance. From deeper within the crypt.

A soft, grating shift of stone on stone.

Tilman froze, his hand closing around the block. He stared past his small fire into the thick darkness of the main passage. The dripping water continued its rhythm. The fire popped.

Then, a whisper of movement. Fabric on stone. A breath, not his own.

He was not alone in the tomb.

He snatched up the block and scrambled to his feet, kicking dust over the fire. The flames guttered and died, plunging the chamber into a darkness now total and suffocating. He pressed himself against the far wall, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had been a fool. The phantom would know of such places. Would check them.

He heard the steps then—slow, deliberate, unhurried. Not the rushed search of a pursuer, but the confident progression of someone in their own domain. They came from the depths of the crypt, moving toward his chamber.

Tilman’s hand found the wall behind him, tracing its surface. It was solid. There was no other exit. He was in a dead end.

The steps stopped at the entrance to his chamber. A long silence stretched, taut as a wire. Tilman held his breath.

“The living rarely appreciate the hospitality of the dead,” a voice said. It was dry, papery, an exhalation from a sepulcher. It was not the watchman’s voice. This was older, frailer, yet threaded with a terrible patience.

A light flared—the sudden, sulfurous strike of a lucifer, followed by the steady glow of a candle being lit. The light bloomed, revealing the figure holding it.

He was ancient, draped in a robe of coarse, undyed wool that hung from his gaunt frame like a shroud. His hair was a wispy white halo around a skull-like face, the skin stretched tight over prominent bones, the eyes deep-set and burning with an intelligence that was chillingly alert. He was not a phantom. He was a hermit. A tomb-dweller.

“You bring fire into the house of silence,” the old man said, his candle casting huge, wavering shadows. “You bring fear into the house of peace. And you bring *that*,” his eyes, sharp as flint, fixed on the block still clutched in Tilman’s hand, “into a place that has forgotten the burdens of objects.”

Tilman could not speak. The encounter was too surreal, too sharply etched against the madness of the night.

The old man took a step into the chamber. He did not seem threatening. He seemed inquisitive, like a naturalist examining a strange beetle. “You are the one they will be looking for. The disturbance in the pattern. I felt it an hour ago. A ripple in the stillness.” He tilted his head. “You have the look of a scholar, not a thief. But then, the greatest thieves are often scholars. They steal truths, not trinkets.”

“Who are you?” Tilman managed, his voice a rasp.

“A caretaker. Of sorts. My name is Kaspar. I tend to these dead, as they have no one else. And in return, they offer me silence. Until tonight.” He raised the candle higher, its light washing over Tilman’s face. “You are wounded. Not in body, but in spirit. The chase has etched itself upon you. And the weight of what you carry is a heavier wound still.”

“You know what this is?” Tilman’s grip tightened on the block.

Kaspar’s smile was a thin crack in parchment. “I know it is a fulcrum. A point upon which great weights are balanced. To possess it is to stand between those weights. It is not a comfortable place.” He gestured with his free hand, a slow, encompassing movement. “This is a comfortable place. Here, the struggles are over. The balances are settled. Dust is the great leveler. I would advise you to leave your fulcrum here. Let the dust take it. Let the balance find its own resolution.”

“I cannot.”

“Because you must know.” Kaspar nodded, as if this was the expected, foolish answer. “The hunger for knowledge is the last hunger to die. It is what separates the living from my quiet companions.” He stepped closer, his candle now illuminating the block in Tilman’s hands. “May I?”

A profound wariness screamed in Tilman’s mind. Yet, the old man’s demeanor held no greed, no urgency. Only a deep, weary curiosity. Slowly, against every instinct, Tilman extended his hand.

Kaspar did not take it. He merely bent forward, bringing the candle close. His eyes, milky at the edges but sharp at the center, traced the carved channel, the black stain. He did not touch it. “Ah,” he breathed, the sound like leaves skittering on stone. “The *Lux in Abscondito*. The Light in Hiding. Or the poison in the honey, depending on the theologian.” He straightened. “You know what it contains?”

“A seed,” Tilman said. “From… from the Garden. A physical fragment.”

Kaspar let out a soft, sighing laugh. “A fragment. Yes. But not of a plant. Think, scholar. The Garden was not a field. It was a state. A confluence. The ‘seed’ is a concentrate. A material echo of that confluence. The stain…” He pointed a bony finger. “That is not tree resin. It is *terra damnata*. Cursed earth. The alchemists’ name for the substrate that can hold a spiritual charge, like a lodestone holds magnetism. And the granules within it… they are not seeds. They are filings. Iron, from a very specific source. The nails.”

The words hung in the cold air. Tilman felt the block grow heavier, colder. “The Passion?”

“The physical anchor of the greatest spiritual confluence the world has ever known,” Kaspar whispered. “Ground to powder, mixed with the earth that drank the blood, suspended in a medium that holds intent. This is not a relic to be venerated. It is a key. Or a trigger. A piece of a machine designed to bridge the gap between the material and the immaterial. To force a door that is meant to stay shut.”

“The phantom wants to open it.”

“The phantom,” Kaspar said, withdrawing his candle, “wants to control what comes through. This,” he nodded at the block, “is one piece of the mechanism. There will be others. A lens. A needle. A cup. Together, in the right place, at the right time, operated with the right knowledge… they would not merely *symbolize* a connection to the divine. They would *enforce* it. They would make the spiritual physical, and the physical spiritual. They would turn faith into a lever, and the soul into a weight to be measured.”

The horror of it unfolded in Tilman’s mind, vast and dizzying. He had imagined a secret doctrine, a hidden history. Not this. Not an engineering of the sacred. “Why? To what end?”

“Power,” Kaspar said simply. “Pure, unambiguous power. To command the attention of heaven is to command the obedience of earth. The Church sells promises of the afterlife. One who held this mechanism, complete, could sell demonstrations. He could become not a pope, but a prophet-king with God’s own voice in his ear, or so he could make men believe. The line between miracle and monstrosity is drawn only by intent.” The old man’s eyes grew distant. “Long ago, there were those who tried. Their order was shattered, their work scattered, hidden, guarded. The phantom is a new hand, reaching for the old, forbidden tools.”

Tilman looked down at the block. Its intricate carving now looked like a schematic. A part of a blueprint for apotheosis. “And I have taken a piece from him.”

“You have not taken it *from* him,” Kaspar corrected gently. “You have taken it *for* him. You have sprung the trap, and now you carry the bait. He will find you. He must. You are now the keeper of the one piece he lacks. Your flight is not an escape. It is a delivery system. He will follow you until you lead him to the others, or until you are run to ground and it is reclaimed.”

The hopelessness of it was a physical blow. He had traded a cloak for a sentence, and the sentence was to be a hound for a master he despised. “What can I do?”

“Three paths,” Kaspar said, holding up three skeletal fingers. The candlelight danced between them. “One: destroy it. Throw it in the Rhine. But the knowledge of its making exists elsewhere. The design is not erased. He would begin again, and you would have nothing. Two: give it to him. Perhaps he lets you live. Perhaps not. You would live, if you did, with the knowledge of what you enabled. Three: understand it. Complete what you began. You sought a spiritual truth. This is its shadow, cast in wood and iron and cursed earth. Find the other pieces before he does. Understand the machine. Only then can you truly break it, or… choose a different use for it.”

“A different use?”

Kaspar’s burning eyes met his. “A machine is a machine. It has no morality. The lever pries up treasure or pries open a skull. The choice belongs to the hand on the lever. The phantom’s hand seeks a throne. What does your hand seek, Tilman?”

The use of his name, unasked, sent a fresh chill through him. “How do you know my name?”

“The dead whisper,” Kaspar said, his smile returning. “And you have been shouting it in your spirit since you entered my domain. You seek God. Not the God of processions and pardons, but the God behind the veil. This,” he pointed again to the block, “is a veil-piercer. A dangerous, blasphemous one. But it is a tool. The question is not whether you should use a tool. The question is what you wish to build.”

The logic was seductive, a dark, twisted path that somehow led back to his original yearning. To not just read about the divine, but to approach it. To not just believe, but to *witness*. The block in his hand was a promise of that. A terrible, damning promise.

“Where are the other pieces?” Tilman asked, his voice hollow.

Kaspar shook his head. “I do not know. The knowledge was broken, scattered. The old order hid them in places of resonance. In sites of great joy, or great sorrow. In buildings raised to touch the sky, or in caves that plumb the earth. Where the veil is thin. The phantom has been searching for decades. He has agents. He has patience. You have only desperation, and now, a little knowledge.”

He turned, his robe whispering against the stone floor. “You cannot stay here. My silence has been broken. They will come here eventually. You must go back into the cage. But now you see the bars for what they are, and you hold a file.”

“Why tell me this?” Tilman asked, the block feeling like a live coal. “Why not just take it?”

Kaspar looked back over his shoulder, his face half in shadow. “I tend the dead, young scholar. I have no interest in the struggles of the living. But I have a fondness for lost causes. And you… you are the most lost cause to have stumbled into my crypt in many years. It amuses me to see what you will do. Now, go. Follow the river south, out of the city. The world is larger than Cologne. The phantom’s web is strong here. Weaken it by leaving.”

He began to walk away, his candle receding, pulling the light and the revelation with him.

“Wait,” Tilman called into the growing darkness. “The watchman in the cellar… is he…?”

The light paused. “A man who sold his silence to a higher bidder. A custodian of a empty trap. He is the least of what will come for you. Do not think of him. Think of the design.”

The candlelight vanished around a corner. Tilman was alone again in the absolute dark, but the darkness was now filled with a terrifying architecture. He saw not just a block of wood, but a component. He felt not just pursued, but positioned. He was a piece on a board he had only just glimpsed.

He slipped the block back inside his tunic. The cold of it was now the cold of a deliberate choice. He could not go back to his old life. It was ash. He could not stand still. He was prey. There was only one direction: into the deeper game.

He felt his way out of the chamber, back down the passage toward the faint grey promise of the doorway. The old man’s words echoed. *Sites of resonance. Where the veil is thin.*

As he emerged from the crypt, the fog greeted him like a shroud. The river lay to his left, a vast, murmuring darkness. South. He would follow the river south. He had a file. He had a direction. And he had, burning in the core of his being where faith and terror met, a new, unthinkable question: not how to hide from the design, but how to turn it.

He melted into the fog, leaving the tomb of the Minorites behind. He was no longer just a fugitive. He was an apprentice to a heresy, and his first lesson was this: to find the light, he must first follow the blueprint of the dark. The running had not just begun. It had acquired a destination.

# Chapter 21

## **Chapter 21**

The forest south of the Rhine was a cathedral of silence. It was not the quiet of absence, but the dense, listening hush of a held breath. The pines stood in solemn ranks, their high canopies stitching a roof against the sky, allowing only a bruised, twilight gloom to sift down to the needle-strewn floor. The air was cold and resinous, smelling of damp earth and slow decay. Tilman moved through it like a penitent, each footfall a muted confession.

He had followed the river for three days, a grey, winding road that led him away from the reek of cities and the phantom’s immediate grasp. The old man’s file was a cold, secret weight against his ribs, a sliver of purpose in a world stripped bare. He was no longer fleeing blindly. He was navigating, using the strange, internal compass the Minorite’s revelation had forged in him. The block of wood, now wrapped in a scrap of oilcloth, felt less like a burden and more like a lodestone. It pulled him not south, but inward, toward a quality of silence that hummed.

The instructions had been precise, a heresy delivered in a crypt. *Where the veil is thin.* He had passed villages where the smoke from hearths hung low and heavy, where the eyes of children tracking him from doorways seemed old and knowing. He had skirted a monastery whose bells tolled with a flat, leaden sound that did not carry. He felt these places as a man with a fever feels a draft—a sharp, intuitive wrongness. They were knots in the phantom’s web, points where the design lay heavy upon the world. He gave them a wide berth.

Now, deep in the forest’s heart, he felt the opposite. A subtle yielding. The silence here was not oppressive, but porous. It was a place where the world seemed less finished, where the lines between root and rock, shadow and substance, blurred. According to the Minorite’s heretical geometry, this was a site of resonance. A place to listen.

He found a clearing where a great beech had fallen, its vast trunk a moss-velveted bench above the forest floor. A stream, no wider than his hand, trickled over black stones beside it. He sat, his back against the cool, living wood of the beech, and let the stillness settle into his bones. He took the block from his tunic, unwrapping it. The pale wood seemed to drink the dim light, its carved channels and impossible angles a script in a language of pressure and void.

This was his work now. To understand the component. Not with the logic of a joiner, but with the perception of a listener. The Minorite’s words were his liturgy. *The design manipulates resonance. It does not build walls; it tunes the space between them.*

He ran his fingers along the channels, eyes closed. He tried not to think of shape, but of sound. Of vibration. He imagined the block not as carved wood, but as a solidified note, a fragment of a chord that could, if joined with others, alter the very frequency of reality. It was a madman’s thought. It was the only thought that made the terror manageable.

A branch snapped.

The sound was a gunshot in the cathedral hush. Tilman’s eyes flew open, his hand closing over the block, shoving it back into his tunic. He was on his feet, pressed against the beech log, his breath a white plume in the cold air.

A figure emerged from the pines.

It was not a phantom’s agent. It was a woman. She was perhaps ten years his senior, her face lean and weathered, framed by a wild braid of hair the colour of ashes and rust. She wore a patched dress of homespun, over which was slung a deerskin jerkin. In her hands she carried a long staff of seasoned ash, and at her belt hung a leather pouch and a small, wicked-looking hatchet. Her eyes, a pale grey like winter sky, fixed on him with an assessment that was neither friendly nor hostile. It was geological.

“You sit in the listening place,” she said. Her voice was low, rasped by weather and disuse. “But you do not know how to listen. You shout with your fear. It echoes for miles.”

Tilman said nothing. His hand crept toward the file at his belt.

She noted the movement and gave a short, derisive sniff. “If I meant you harm, you would already be feeding the roots. Put your toy away.” She leaned her staff against the fallen beech and knelt by the stream, cupping water to her mouth. She drank with the economical grace of a forest creature. “You are the one from the north. The one they whisper about.”

A cold deeper than the forest air seeped into Tilman’s veins. “Who whispers?”

“The trees. The stones. The water that runs from places where men pray in the wrong key.” She stood, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. “They have been… agitated. For weeks now. A sour note on the wind. Then, three days past, a new vibration. Faint. Clumsy. But purposeful. You.”

She approached him, circling the clearing with a slow, measured tread. She was not looking at him, but at the space around him, at the ground where he had stood, at the air he had displaced. “You carry a wrong thing. And you seek a right place to undo it. A dangerous recipe.”

“Who are you?” Tilman asked, his voice tight.

“A caretaker. Some call me a witch. The monks at Altenberg call me a nuisance. The forest calls me nothing. It simply is. I am Ericha.” She stopped her circling and faced him. “The old man in the crypt. He sent you.”

It was not a question. Tilman felt the last of his secrecy stripped away. This woman, in this silent wood, knew the shape of his heresy. He could only nod.

“A brave fool,” Ericha said, a flicker of something like pity in her eyes. “Or a desperate one. It amounts to the same. He gives you a key and tells you to find a lock, but does not tell you the key itself is a wound. To use it is to bleed.”

“I have no other path.”

“Paths are for those who wish to arrive somewhere. You wish to un-arrive. To unmake. That is a different walking.” She gestured to the ground. “Sit. Your fear is still shouting. We must quiet it before the wrong things hear.”

Hesitantly, Tilman sat. Ericha sat opposite him, cross-legged, her staff across her knees. She closed her eyes and breathed, a long, slow inhalation that seemed to draw the very stillness of the clearing into her. Tilman, uncertain, tried to mimic her. He closed his eyes. The silence rushed in, but it was filled with the thunder of his own pulse, the memory of pursuit, the phantom’s smile.

“You listen to the inside of your own skull,” Ericha’s voice came, soft but clear. “That is a tiny room with loud echoes. Listen past it. To the water. Not the sound of it, but the *pace* of it. To the sap in the beech log at your back. To the mile-deep sigh of the stone beneath this soil. Find the biggest silence you can, and let your small noise be lost in it.”

It felt like foolishness. Like monkish meditation. But he had no other tool. He tried. He let the chatter of his terror wear itself out against the immense, patient backdrop of the forest. Slowly, like a fever breaking, the tight coil in his chest began to loosen. The phantom’s face receded. The image of the watchman’s empty eyes blurred. There was only the cold air, the scent of moss, the endless, gentle trickle of the stream.

When he opened his eyes, the light in the clearing had changed. It was softer, more golden, as if the gloom had been polished. Ericha was watching him.

“Better,” she said. “Now. Show me the wrong thing.”

He hesitated for only a second. Then, he drew out the block. He did not hand it to her, but placed it on the moss between them.

Ericha did not touch it. She leaned forward, her grey eyes narrowing. She did not look at the carvings, but seemed to gaze through the wood, at the space it displaced. Her face grew grim.

“Ah,” she breathed. “Yes. A knot. A knot tied in the fabric of *what is*. To pull it tight is to distort the weave around it. This…” she finally reached out, not to pick it up, but to pass her palm slowly over its surface, a hairsbreadth away. “…this is a tool of persuasion. It whispers to the world, *be other than you are*. And the world, in that small place, obeys.”

“Can it be undone?”

“A knot can be cut, or it can be patiently worked loose. The first is violence. It leaves a tear. The second is craft. It requires understanding the twist of every fibre.” She looked at him. “The old man believes in craft. In counter-resonance. A tuning fork to still a bell. He seeks not to destroy the design, but to… re-harmonize it.” She sat back, her expression unreadable. “A beautiful, terrifying ambition. It requires a musician of impossible skill. Are you that?”

“I am a carpenter who cannot go home.”

A faint, grim smile touched her lips. “Then you begin with the right humility. Very well. The listening place has accepted your presence. It will tolerate your work. But you cannot do it here, in the open air. The wrong thing will call to its kindred. You need a chamber. A bell-jar.”

She stood, shouldering her staff. “Come. Your apprenticeship requires a workshop.”

She led him deeper into the forest, away from the stream. They walked for perhaps an hour, until the pines gave way to a tumble of mossy granite boulders, the bones of an ancient hill. In the lee of the largest stone, half-hidden by a curtain of ivy and thorn, was a low opening. It was not a cave, but a space formed by two great slabs leaning together.

Ericha pushed aside the thorny veil. “In,” she said.

Tilman ducked inside. The space was small, taller than it was wide, the air cool and dry and thick with the smell of stone and old leaves. A faint, phosphorescent lichen grew in patches on the walls, providing a ghostly, blue-green light. In the centre was a flat stone, like a table.

“A root-cellar, from a time before men here knew wood,” Ericha said, entering behind him. “The stone is dense. It muffles. It contains. Here, you can make your clumsy noises without broadcasting them to every tuned ear between here and the Alps.” She pointed to the flat stone. “Your bench. Your work will be part carving, part prayer. A heretical liturgy. I will bring you food. Water. I will teach you to listen until your ears bleed with the truth of things. And you…” she fixed him with her pale eyes, “…you will tell me everything. Every detail the old man gave you. Every sensation the block gives you. We will find the counter-frequency. Not to silence the bell, but to change its song.”

For the first time since the crypt, Tilman felt a flicker that was not fear. It was the fragile, terrifying spark of agency. He had a teacher. He had a sanctuary. He had a task that was more than mere survival.

He placed the block on the stone table. In the faint lichen-light, the carvings seemed deeper, more profound, like canyons on a miniature world.

His work began.

Days blurred into a rhythm of stone-bound silence and Ericha’s sharp, demanding tutelage. She taught him to differentiate between the hum of a living pine and the dead drone of a lightning-struck oak. She made him place his hands on the granite walls for hours, feeling for the deep, sub-audible pulse of the earth’s turning. She was a brutal, exacting mentor, with no patience for his frustration.

“You think with your hands, carpenter,” she would snap. “That is good. But you must *feel* with your mind. The design is not physical. It is a pattern of influence. A persuasion. You must feel the persuasion.”

He would sit with the block for hours, the file in his hand, not daring to touch it to the wood. He would trace the channels, mapping them in his mind, trying to hear the note they were meant to produce. He felt nothing but wood and his own desperation.

Then, one evening, as a storm growled outside, muting even the stone chamber’s silence, he broke.

“I cannot hear it!” he hissed, slamming his palm on the stone. “It is just wood! Dead wood!”

Ericha, who had been weaving a basket from willow withes by the entrance, did not look up. “Perhaps you are listening for the wrong thing. You seek a sound. Perhaps the design speaks in… absence. In a kind of silencing.”

Tilman stared at the block, his anger draining away, replaced by a cold clarity. *A knot tied in the fabric of what is.* He thought not of the carved ridges, but of the empty channels between them. The voids. He picked up the file. Not to carve, but to probe. He inserted its tip into a shallow, angled channel that ran along the block’s flank.

He closed his eyes. He thought not of sound, but of pressure. Of a current flowing through the channel, a current of *intent*. He imagined the file not as a tool, but as a probe, feeling for the current’s direction, its force.

And he felt it.

A faint, sickening *pull*. Not a vibration, but a suction. A tiny, localized vortex that seemed to draw not on air, but on possibility itself. It was the feeling of a word being taken from your tongue, a memory dissolving at its edges. It was the phantom’s smile given a tactile form.

He gasped, jerking the file back as if burned.

Ericha was at his side in an instant. “What?”

“I felt it,” he whispered, his heart hammering. “It’s… a drain. A tiny, hungry drain.”

Her eyes gleamed in the lichen-light. “Show me.”

Guided by the new, visceral sense, Tilman explored the block. Each channel, each junction, was not a conductor of resonance, but a manipulator of absence. They were tiny engines of erasure, tuned to specific frequencies of reality—doubt, perhaps, or memory, or faith. Joined together in a larger structure, they would create a field of profound, directed negation. A sanctuary not for God, but for the hollowing out of God.

“It doesn’t build a wall,” Tilman said, understanding dawning like a cold, grey dawn. “It creates a… a vacancy. A shaped void that something else can fill.”

Ericha nodded, her face grave. “And your counter-resonance? To fill a void, you do not shout. You must provide a… gentler substance. A different pressure.” She pointed to a particular junction where three channels met. “Here. The emptiness is compounded. If you were to introduce a harmonic presence here, a vibration that asserts *is-ness* without aggression… you could perhaps soften the edges. Dull the hunger.”

It was theory. Mad, heretical theory. But it was a map.

Tilman took up a fresh piece of wood—a scrap of dense, close-grained boxwood Ericha had procured. He did not try to copy the block. He tried to answer it. He began to carve, not channels of absence, but a single, continuous, raised ridge that spiralled inward. A labyrinth, not to trap, but to *contain* a presence. He worked by the ghostly light, guided by the sickening pull of the original block, trying to craft its opposite. His world shrank to the point of the file, the whisper of curling wood, the intense, focused silence of the stone chamber.

He lost track of time. Ericha came and went, leaving bread, cheese, a skin of water. She watched his progress, offering only the occasional, cryptic correction. “Softer here. The pressure is too direct. You are pushing. You must *invite*.”

One day, or perhaps night—the light in the chamber never changed—he finished. He held the two pieces of wood on his open palms. The original block, pale and sinister. His response, a dark, spiralled disc. They did not fit together. They were not parts of a whole. They were a question and a stammering, imperfect reply.

“Now,” Ericha said. “The test. Not here. The stone would confound it. Outside. In the listening place.”

They returned to the clearing by the fallen beech. The air was crisp, the silence absolute. Tilman’s heart thudded against his ribs. This was the moment. Would it work? Or would it simply be a flare, announcing his location to every tuned ear in the phantom’s network?

He placed the original block on the flat stone by the stream. He felt its familiar, hungry pull immediately, a cold spot in the world. He took his spiral disc and, following an intuition that felt less like thought and more like the memory of a dream, he held it directly above the junction of the three channels.

He closed his eyes. He did not listen. He *offered*. He poured his will into the spiral—not a command, but an affirmation. A single, silent word: *Here*.

For a long moment, nothing.

Then, a change in the air. The cold spot did not vanish. But its edges… blurred. The hungry pull softened, diluted, as if mixed with still water. The silence of the clearing, which had felt watchful, relaxed by a fraction. A bird, somewhere high in the canopy, let out a single, questioning note.

He opened his eyes. The two pieces of wood lay inert. But something had happened. A minuscule, localised re-harmonization.

Ericha let out a long, slow breath. “A whisper,” she said. “But a true one. You have found the first note of the counter-song.”

A fierce, exhausted triumph flooded Tilman. It was a start. A fragile, infinitesimal start. He had not just hidden from the design. He had, in the smallest way possible, answered it.

He looked at his hands, stained with wood dust and lichen-light. They were no longer just a fugitive’s hands. They were the hands of a saboteur of the absolute.

The hook for his spirit, so long mired in terror and flight, finally caught on something solid: a purpose woven from silence and heresy. He had a craft. He had a teacher. He had the first, trembling note of a weapon.

But as he gathered his pieces, the triumph cooled, tempered by Ericha’s next words, spoken softly into the gathering dusk.

“You have learned to whisper back,” she said. “But remember, carpenter. To whisper is to speak. And now, you have given the silence your voice. They will be listening for it.” She looked south, through the trees, toward the unseen mountains. “Your sanctuary is now a beacon. The work will get harder. The listeners will get closer. You have stopped running. Now, you must learn to stand, and to tune the coming storm.”

## **Chapter 22**

The forest around Ericha’s hut no longer felt like a refuge. It felt like a stage. The air, once a blanket of quiet, was now a taut skin, a sounding board for every snapped twig, every rustle in the bracken. Tilman’s triumph, that fierce spark he had carried back from the clearing, had guttered in the face of her warning. He had not found a hiding place. He had struck a tuning fork. Somewhere, in the deep and structured silence of the world’s design, a faint, discordant hum now existed. And it bore the signature of his will.

He worked with a new, grim focus. The hut’s single room was a workshop now, a commandery of quiet rebellion. The floor was a mosaic of wood shavings, pale curls of oak and ash and a strange, dark wood Ericha called ‘moon-fall’, scavenged from a lightning-struck trunk. His tools, once kept in orderly rows, were laid out in a state of permanent readiness—gouges, chisels, the fine-toothed saw, the block plane with its worn horn handle. He was no longer carving boxes. He was assembling an arsenal of whispers.

Ericha watched from her stool by the cold hearth, her hands busy with the endless task of braiding dried nettle-fibre into cord. Her silence was no longer merely observational. It was diagnostic. She listened to his work: the *scritch-scritch* of his knife notching a spiral, the softer *shush* of pumice smoothing an edge, the faint, almost musical *tonk* as he tapped a completed piece against the hearthstone. She was listening for the note in it, the quality of his intent.

“Less force,” she said, her voice cutting through an afternoon’s quiet. He was working on a new piece, a interlocking puzzle of three rods, each channeled with a different pattern. “You are persuading wood, not commanding it. Your frustration is a clumsy chisel. It widens the groove but blurs the pattern.”

Tilman set the rod down, his fingers aching. “It won’t hold the offering. The channels are true, I measured them.”

“The wood is not geometry,” she replied, not looking up from her braiding. “It is memory. It remembers the wind, the weight of snow, the sap’s pulse. You must make your pattern a part of that memory, not a scar upon it. You are still shouting your heresy. You must learn to breathe it.”

He picked up the rod again, closed his eyes, and ran his thumb along the shallow groove. He thought not of the pattern, but of the tree it came from—a tall, straight ash that had grown in a sun-dappled part of the wood. He imagined the slow, patient growth, the rings laid down year after patient year. His offering, when he pushed it gently from his mind’s edge into the wood, was not *Here*, but *Thus*. An alignment. A gentle suggestion of an alternative shape for the world to remember.

The wood, in his hand, seemed to grow warmer. Not with heat, but with a kind of acquiescence. The channel, under his thumb, felt less like a cut and more like a grain.

“Better,” Ericha murmured. “A shadow of a whisper. But a shadow can be enough.”

The lessons turned practical, and in doing so, grew more perilous. She began to send him out not to find quiet places, but to find sick ones. A stand of pines where the needles grew brittle and grey, the sap within them sluggish and sour. A stream pool that was too still, too cold, its surface refusing to hold the sky’s reflection properly. These were not the great, hungry cold spots, but local malaises, knots of dissonance in the forest’s song.

His task was not to cure them. “You cannot heal a wound in the design with your childish tools,” she said. “But you can… confuse it. Introduce a sympathetic vibration. Make the sickness doubt itself.”

At the pine stand, he buried a small, forked piece of moon-fall carved with counter-rotating spirals at the base of the central tree. He did not offer to the sickness. He offered to the memory of health he sensed buried deep in the heartwood—a faint, almost extinguished echo of vitality. He offered it back to the tree, amplified through his carving.

Three days later, the grey on the needles had not receded, but it had not spread. The sickness was contained, puzzled.

At the stream pool, he set a floating lattice of ash-wood on the water, its connections tied with Ericha’s nettle-cord. The pattern was one of gentle dispersion. He sat on the bank for hours, not pouring his will into it, but simply *sustaining* the intention, a quiet, constant hum of *move-along, move-along*. By dusk, a single maple leaf, blown from upstream, circled lazily on the pool’s surface. The next morning, the leaf was gone. The water was not yet reflective, but it had lost its dead, gelid stillness. It was water again, not a trap for light.

He was learning the grammar of his silent craft. But with each small success, the stage upon which he worked seemed to grow larger, the audience more imminent. He began to dream not of the cold, pulling silence, but of listeners. Formless, attentive presences at the edge of perception, turning their regard slowly, patiently, toward a faint static in the song of things. Toward a forest that was, in tiny, inexplicable ways, failing to sicken as it should.

One evening, as a slow, cold rain dripped from the thatch, Ericha spoke of the listeners directly for the first time.

“They are called the *Eichhörner*,” she said, feeding a twist of damp moss into the small fire. “The Oak-hearts. Do not think of men in robes. Think of… gardeners. Tenders of a vast, terrible orchard. Their senses are not like ours. They do not hear a footstep or see a smoke. They feel a strain in the weave. A snag. Your whispers are such snags.”

“How many?” Tilman asked, his voice low.

She shrugged. “Does a hive count its bees? They are a order. A function. Some will be attuned to the great harmonies—the lay lines, the mountain’s pulse. Others to smaller things. The song of a city district. The health of a forest. One of these lesser listeners may already be turning their ear toward this wood, wondering at the odd, stubborn health of a pine stand, the strange reluctance of a pool to die.”

“What do we do?”

“We make more snags,” she said, a ruthless glint in her old eyes. “But we make them elsewhere. We send their attention on a chase. You will learn misdirection.”

The next phase of his work began. He carved not for effect, but for resonance. Small, potent pieces meant to be left in places of natural resonance—a rocky outcrop that hummed in a west wind, a particular fork in the stream where the water chuckled over stone in a perfect, repeating tone. These pieces were not designed to heal or counter. They were designed to *vibrate*. To send out a faint, enticing echo of the heresy he practiced, a will-o’-the-wisp of discord to draw a listener’s gaze.

He became a phantom in the wider forest. He would hike for miles, place a singing-piece with painstaking care, and retreat, leaving behind a ghost of his signature. It was exhausting, nerve-wracking work. Every journey felt like a patrol through occupied territory. The call of a jay made him freeze. The distant crack of a falling branch was a thunderclap of alarm.

He returned from one such journey, mud-splattered and soul-weary, to find Ericha not at her braiding, but standing rigid in the centre of the hut. Her head was cocked, her eyes closed. In her hands was a long, straight wand of hazel, held lightly between her thumbs and forefingers.

“Be silent,” she breathed, before he could speak.

He stood frozen in the doorway. She stood there, unmoving, for a full five minutes. The only sound was the drip of water from his cloak onto the earthen floor. Finally, her shoulders slumped a fraction. The hazel wand twitched in her hands, then stilled.

She opened her eyes. They were clouded with a deep fatigue. “A bee has entered the hive,” she said quietly. “The disturbance is noted. A listener is assigned. The search has a direction now. South-east of here, toward the Blücher Valley. One of your singing-pieces has been found.”

A cold knot tightened in Tilman’s gut. “Will they trace it back?”

“Not directly. The piece is just a vibration. A scent. But the scent is now in the air. The hunt is no longer general. It has a quadrant.” She looked at him, her expression unreadable. “This is the work. You are no longer whispering in a sealed room. You are leaving your pamphlets in the town square. They will find them. And they will look for the press.”

Two days later, the forest itself told them the hunt had intensified.

Tilman was gathering fungi at the base of a rotten elm, a half-mile from the hut, when the birdsong died. It did not taper off. It ceased, as if a door had been shut. The usual background murmur of the wood—the rustle, the creak, the insect hum—faded into a profound, watchful silence. It was not the hungry silence of a cold spot. This was a held breath. A respectful, fearful stillness.

He dropped into a crouch, his hand closing around the haft of his belt-knife. He scanned the green-grey gloom. Nothing moved.

Then, from the south-east, from the direction of the Blücher Valley, a sound came. It was low, almost sub-audible, more a felt tremor in the ground than a noise. A single, deep, resonant *thrum*, like the pluck of a string made from stone and root. It passed through the earth, up through the soles of his boots, and into his bones. It was not music. It was a query. A single, powerful note of pure, structured order, sent out to see what would resonate with it.

The forest offered no answer. It remained silent, cowed.

The *thrum* faded. For a long minute, nothing. Then, from a different direction—closer to the east—another answered. A softer, higher note, an acknowledgement. A report.

Coordinates were being shared.

Tilman did not run. Ericha had drilled that into him. Flight was a vibration. Panic was a shout. He moved with an agonising, deliberate slowness, placing each foot with the care of a man walking on ice, keeping to the thickest patches of fern and shadow. It took him an hour to cover the half-mile back to the hut.

Ericha was waiting, her few possessions already bundled. The fire was scattered, the ashes cold and mixed with soil.

“They are triangulating,” she said, her voice brisk, devoid of fear. “The first was a seeker. The second, a local witness. They are comparing notes. This area is now of interest. The sanctuary is compromised.”

“Where do we go?” Tilman asked, his own pack already in his hands, his carvings wrapped in oilcloth at its core.

“We do not go. You go. I am a static echo in this wood. My pattern is set, my song long since sung. I am part of the background noise to them. You are the new vibration. The active signal.”

“I won’t leave you.”

“You will,” she said, and there was a finality in her tone that brooked no argument. “This was always the path. The teacher remains. The student carries the craft into the world. Your apprenticeship is over, Tilman. It ended the moment that seeker’s note sounded. Now you must practice.”

She thrust a small, heavy pouch into his hands. It clinked softly. “Coin. Not much. Go north and west. To the riverlands. The chaos of water and trade and many minds will provide some cover. Find a city. Not a great one. A middling place, loud with life. Get work. Keep your head down. And listen. Listen for the sick places, the cold spots in the human hive. And whisper back.”

He stood there, hollowed out. The hut, the forest, this fierce, old woman—they had been the only solid ground in a world of shifting terror. Now she was pushing him off it.

“How will I know what to do?”

“You will know. You are no longer a carpenter, nor merely a fugitive. You are a saboteur. Your enemy is the absolute. Your weapon is the sympathetic vibration. Your battlefield is anywhere the song is forced into a single, rigid tune.” She reached up and placed a gnarled hand on his cheek. Her touch was dry and rough as bark. “Remember the first lesson. Do not listen to the silence. Speak to it. And now, you must run. Not in fear. As a tactic. Go.”

There was no more time for words. The memory of that deep, earth-shaking *thrum* was a goad. He shouldered his pack, met her flinty eyes one last time, and turned toward the north-west path.

He did not look back. Looking back was a vibration. He walked, then jogged, then ran, the trees blurring past him, not as shelter now, but as witnesses to his flight. He ran until his lungs burned and the light began to fail. He ran until the character of the forest changed, the ancient, watchful oaks giving way to younger, denser thickets of birch and alder.

As dusk settled, he stumbled into a small, hidden clearing beside a chuckling brook. He collapsed against a mossy log, gasping. He was alone. Utterly, terrifyingly alone.

He fumbled in his pack, not for food, but for a piece of wood. A simple, unfinished block of ash. He took out his knife. His hands were shaking. The silence here was not the structured silence of the hunters. It was the empty silence of exile.

He could not still his hands. He could not find the focus. The memory of the *Eichhörner’s* query-note vibrated in his marrow. He was a snag in the weave. A known anomaly. He was running again.

A wave of despair, black and cold, washed over him. He had traded one terror for another. He had exchanged the fear of being consumed for the fear of being hunted. He was a mouse who had learned to squeak a defiant tune, only to find the owl’s head swiveling precisely toward the sound.

He gripped the block of ash until his knuckles turned white. He closed his eyes, not to offer, but to plead. *What now?*

No answer came from the wood. No answer came from the memory of Ericha’s voice. There was only the babble of the brook, a mindless, cheerful sound.

And then, a thought, not as a voice, but as a cold, clear realisation: the brook was not silent. It was a riot of noise, a chaotic, ever-changing song. It was the opposite of the seeker’s single, pure note. It was cover.

He opened his eyes. He looked at the block in his hand, then at the rushing water. He did not carve it. Instead, he stood, walked to the water’s edge, and placed the blank block on a flat stone in the midst of the stream. The water parted around it, splashing, gurgling, indifferent.

He would not hide his vibration. He would drown it in a greater noise. He would go to the loud, chaotic, stinking, glorious world of men. He would become a whisper in a shouting crowd. A single wrong note in a cacophonous symphony.

The hunt was on. But the forest was vast, and the world beyond it was infinitely louder and more complex. He had a craft. He had a purpose. And he had, for the first time, a destination that was not just an escape, but a strategy.

He retrieved the wet block, tucked it into his pack, and turned his face toward the distant smell of woodsmoke and river-mud. The student was gone. The saboteur, alone and hunted, began his long walk toward the dissonant sanctuary of the human world.

# Chapter 23

## **Chapter 23**

The world of men was a symphony of discord. It was not a single, overwhelming roar, but a layered, grinding cacophony that wore at the edges of the soul. Tilman walked into it as a man might walk into a freezing river: first the shock, then the numbness, then a creeping, profound cold that promised to stop the heart if he lingered too long.

He followed the woodsmoke and the river-mud smell, which resolved into the reek of tanneries, the greasy pall of cook-fires, the sweet-rot stench of middens, and the pervasive, ammoniac tang of humanity packed too close. The forest paths became cart-tracks, then muddy lanes skirting wattle-and-daub hovels, then proper streets leading to a market town whose name he did not ask. The brook’s cheerful babble was swallowed by the clatter of carts, the barking of dogs, the shouted negotiations of the market square, the ceaseless, formless murmur of a hundred conversations in which he had no part.

He was a snag in the weave. Here, the weave was so tangled, so knotted with competing threads, he hoped he might pass for just another loose end.

He found a corner in a crowded inn-yard, not the common room where stories were traded and attention paid, but the stable-loft, where a few coins bought a space in the hay beside snoring carters and their reeking boots. He carved there. Not the deep, listening work of the *Eichhörnchen*, but the shallow, repetitive patterns of a journeyman with no master: spoons, simple boxes, a child’s top. He sold them in the market for a few pennies, his head down, his words few. The vibration of his work was there, a faint, personal hum beneath his fingers, but he poured it into trivial forms. He made his offering to the noise. A single, pure note of seeking would be lost here, he reasoned, drowned in the spiritual din of hunger, lust, boredom, and petty ambition that thrummed through the place.

He was wrong.

The wrongness did not come as a shock, but as a slow, sickening dawning. It began with a feeling of thickness in the air of the market, a day when the chatter seemed forced, the laughter brittle. He felt watched. Not by any one pair of eyes, but by the space itself. The noise, his sanctuary, had developed a strange, uniform texture, like a fabric woven too tight. He could not breathe through it.

Then, he saw the first box.

It sat on the stall of a ribbon-seller, a small thing of pale, unvarnished linden wood. Its carving was competent, bland: interlocking circles, a common motif. But its *stillness* was absolute. It did not hum. It did not whisper. It was a hole in the noise, a tiny, perfect nullity. A silence that consumed the sound around it. He stared, his own half-finished spoon forgotten in his hand. It was not an *Eichhörnchen* piece. It was something else. Something that did not ask, but *absorbed*.

He bought it, his fingers clumsy on the coins. Back in the loft, he held it. The wood was dead. Not dormant, but extinguished. It was the opposite of everything he understood. It did not seek connection; it denied it. It was a wall.

The next market day, he saw another. On the belt of a prosperous butcher, a toggle of dark oak, carved with a geometric pattern. The same deadness. The same silent hunger. Then a third: a child’s rattle in the hands of a merchant’s wife. Each was a drop of nullity in the human clamour. Each was a trap, not for the spirit, but for the evidence of spirit.

They were not hunting for *him*, Tilman realized with a cold that reached deeper than the river’s chill. They were draining the pond to find the fish. The *Eichhörnchen* had refined their search. They were no longer casting a single, precise query-note. They were deploying a blanket of silence, a spiritual vacuum. In the quiet patches, any remaining vibration—his vibration—would shine like a beacon.

His strategy was not just failing; it had been anticipated and turned against him. The dissonant sanctuary was being methodically sanitized.

The despair that followed was a different creature from the cold wave in the forest. That had been clean, a sharp recognition of peril. This was a slow, suffocating mud. It seeped into his lungs as he breathed the loft-dust, into his bones with the damp. The spiritual seeking that had driven him—first for his sister, then for understanding, then for cover—curled in on itself. What was there to seek in a world being methodically scoured of all seekable things? The *Eichhörnchen* were not just protectors of a mystery. They were its gardeners, and they were weeding. He was a weed.

He stopped carving. The pennies dwindled. The carters’ snores became irritants, their smells an assault. The noise of the town, once his shield, was now the sound of the sheep pen awaiting the shearer. He was a snag, and the whole tapestry was being pulled taut to snap him loose.

He took to walking at night, through the stinking alleys where the only sounds were the scuttle of rats and the occasional drunkard’s mutter. Even here, he saw them. A dead-wood sign above a tavern door, its carved grapes devoid of any offering of plenty. A fence-post, newly replaced, humming with a hollow absence. The silence was spreading.

One such night, near the tanner’s quarter where the stench was a physical wall, he found a chapel. It was a poor, squat thing of rough stone, dedicated to some minor saint forgotten by all but the most desperate. Its door hung ajar. Driven by a need older than the *Eichhörnchen*, older than carving, he slipped inside.

It was dark, the air stale with old incense and mildew. The only light came from a guttering rush-dip before a crude wooden statue. The saint’s face was worn smooth by generations of touches, its features blurred into an expression of generic mercy. Tilman did not approach the altar. He slumped on a bench at the back, his pack between his feet, a hollow man in a hollow place.

He closed his eyes. He did not plead. The concept of an answer had become absurd. He simply sat in the manufactured silence of his hunters and the older, emptier silence of a god who had long ago stopped listening to this place. He was a mouse who had fled to the owl’s own tree.

And then, a vibration.

It was faint. Terribly faint. A tremble so small it was less a sound than a memory of a sound, felt not in the ears but in the cavity of the chest. It came from the statue.

He opened his eyes. He stared at the lump of old wood. It was not dead. Beneath the layers of grime and human grease, under the weight of rote, unimaginative devotion, something persisted. Not an offering. A *residue*. The accumulated, faded echoes of every genuine plea, every moment of true despair or gratitude that had been breathed toward it over centuries. It was not a tuned instrument like an *Eichhörnchen* piece. It was a midden of spiritual experience, a compost of hope and fear. It did not seek. It simply *was*, saturated with the unrefined stuff of human seeking.

It was the noise. The true, spiritual noise he had tried to hide in. Not the cacophony of the market, but the profound, discordant choir of unmet need. It was not a shield. It was the battlefield itself.

A thought, cold and clear as the one by the brook, formed. They were creating silence to find him. But silence, true silence, was an aberration. It was the void the *Eichhörnchen* themselves feared. Their tools were little voids, but they were surrounded by the vast, humming residue of human spirit, past and present. They could not erase it all. They could only spot the anomalies within it.

He was an anomaly. But what if he stopped being a single, distinct note? What if he stopped trying to hide his vibration, and instead… diffused it?

He looked at his hands. He thought of the trivial spoons, the empty boxes. He had been making silent things to hide a singing self. It was a contradiction. The *Eichhörnchen* tools were silent because they were meant to listen. His silence was a lie, and lies were thin, fragile things.

He stood, his legs stiff. He walked to the statue. He did not pray to it. He laid a hand on the worn foot of the saint. The faint, chaotic hum was like the warmth of sun on stone long after dusk. It was not power. It was testament.

He returned to the loft as the grey dawn leaked through the chinks in the walls. The carters were stirring, groaning, hawking and spitting. He ignored them. He opened his pack and took out his tools. He took out the blank block of ash from the brook, now dry and smooth. He did not seek a shape within it. He held it, and he thought not of offering, but of *receiving*.

He thought of the dead box from the ribbon-seller. A perfect, hungry silence. He thought of the chapel statue. A rich, confused residue.

He began to carve.

He did not carve a pattern. He carved a vessel. A small, lidded urn, its lines simple, its form humble. But as he carved, he did not pour his own seeking into it. Instead, he opened himself. He let in the noise of the loft: the rasp of breath, the complaint of joints, the dull ache of morning. He let in the memory of the market’s greed and fear, the chapel’s faded hopes, the brook’s mindless song. He let the block absorb it all, the chaotic spiritual detritus of the world, and he worked it into the grain. He was not making a tool for the *Eichhörnchen*. He was making a cup to hold the dregs of human experience. A tiny, focused echo of the saint’s foot.

When he was done, the urn sat in his palm. It did not hum with a single note. It *murmured*. A low, indistinct babble, like a crowd heard from a great distance. It was not attractive. It was not beautiful. It was a piece of spiritual clutter. He placed the dead linden wood box inside it and closed the lid. The box’s nullity was still there, but now it was muffled, lost in the urn’s internal cacophony. A silence, swallowed by a greater, more complex noise.

It was a hiding place, but not for him. For the evidence.

A wild, desperate plan, the seed in the darkness, began to unfurl. They were using silence as a net. He would use noise as a fog. He would not run from their hunt. He would pollute the hunting ground.

For days, he worked. He carved more urns, small pots, hollow beads. Each one, he filled not with his soul, but with the spiritual ambient noise of a place: the tense avarice of the dice-game behind the inn, the weary lust of the brothel alley, the simple animal contentment of the sun on a dung-heap. He made spiritual junk. He became a factory of humble, murmuring clutter.

He began to seed it. He sold the pieces for a pittance, or simply left them in places—on a windowsill, by a well, tucked into the thatch of a hovel. A bead strung on a drunkard’s cord. A pot holding pins for a seamstress. They were worthless. They were everywhere. Each one a tiny, babbling source of meaningless spiritual static.

The feeling of thickness in the air did not lessen, but it changed. The *Eichhörnchen’s* net of silence was being cast into waters now clouded with a thousand trivial, conflicting vibrations. The dead-wood boxes and toggles were still there, but their silent screams were now one among many whispers. The hunt was not called off. It was confused.

Tilman knew it was a stopgap. A feint. He was buying time, not finding salvation. The spiritual seeking had turned inward, upon the mechanism of the hunt itself. To seek was to be found. So he had ceased to seek, and had begun to *emit*. He had become a source of pollution.

It could not last. They would adapt. Their silence would become more aggressive, a vacuum that could suck the noise from his trinkets. Or they would simply close the net, town by town, until he had nowhere left to run and fog.

He needed a final move. A definitive act of noise.

He remembered Ericha’s voice. *“The offering must be true, or it is nothing.”* His trinkets were not true. They were echoes of truth, shadows. To make a noise loud enough to break the net, he would have to offer something real. Not his skill, not his fear. The source of the seeking itself.

He sat in the loft, the last of his coins gone, the carvers gone to their beds. He held a final block of wood, a good-sized piece of oak he’d traded his last proper spoon for. He knew what he had to carve. It was the one thing he had never dared, not since the day he whittled a bird for a girl who was already gone. The one true thing.

He began to carve his sister’s face.

He did not work from clear memory; memory was a traitor. He worked from the ache. From the hollow space her absence had worn in the world. He carved the ghost of a smile he could barely recall, the set of the jaw that was his own, the eyes that had held a light he had spent his life trying to find elsewhere. He poured into it not a question, but a testament. He carved the loss. He carved the love that was the engine of all his seeking. He carved the unanswered, unanswerable void she had left. It was not an offering to the *Eichhörnchen*. It was an offering *of* the *Eichhörnchen’s* own foundational mystery: the human heart, broken and persistent.

As he worked, the murmuring trinkets he had seeded throughout the town seemed to quiet, as if listening. The very air grew still, the blanket of *Eichhörnchen* silence pulling tight, sensing a profound, coherent vibration coalescing from the fog of noise. He was drawing their attention. Deliberately. He was becoming the snag again, but this time, he was the one pulling the thread.

The oak took shape under his tools. It was not a perfect likeness. It was something better and worse: a raw, spiritual portrait. It vibrated with a pure, terrible frequency of grief and love, a note so clear and strong it threatened to shatter the wood that held it.

He finished as true dawn approached, his hands cramping, his body trembling with exhaustion and emotional ruin. He held the finished bust. It was alive in a way nothing he had ever made was alive. It did not ask. It *declared*. It was a beacon.

He heard it then. Not a query-note, but a reaction. A dissonant chord of surprise and… recognition? It came from everywhere and nowhere. The net was contracting. The hunters were converging. Not on a mouse in the grass, but on a bonfire he had lit in the centre of the field.

He wrapped the bust in a scrap of sacking, his movements calm, final. He placed it in his pack. He did not look back at the loft.

He walked out into the cold morning. The town was stirring, but the usual noise felt muted, distant. The *Eichhörnchen* were here, in force. The air was crystalline with focused silence, a bubble forming around him, pushing back the world’s babble. They were done with subtlety.

He did not run. He walked to the market square, the epicentre of the human noise he had tried to use. He stood in the empty space where the stalls would soon be raised. He took the bust from his pack and unwrapped it. He placed it on the cold cobbles.

Then he turned and walked away, leaving it there—a raw, beating heart of human seeking laid bare on the stones. An offering of unbearable truth.

It was the loudest noise he could make. A scream of memory in the gathering silence. Let them hear it. Let them have it. Let them try to silence *that*.

He did not look back. He melted into an alley, just another shadow as the first stall-holders arrived. He heard no cry, no sound of discovery. But he felt the moment. A shockwave through the taut, silent air, a spiritual detonation as the *Eichhörnchen* net closed on the one thing it could not comprehend, could not absorb, could not silence.

The hunt was on. But he was no longer the prey. He was the man who had just thrown a lit torch into the owl’s nest. He had sought, and in seeking, he had found not an answer, but a weapon. The final sanctuary was not in hiding, but in the terrible, vulnerable act of showing exactly what it was they sought to erase.

He walked toward the city gates, the true resolution coiling cold and sharp in his gut. He had planted the seed. Now he would go to the root. Cologne awaited. And in its cathedral shadows, amidst the greatest spiritual architecture of men, he would see what grew from the soil of his despair.

# Chapter 24

## **Chapter 24**

The rain in Cologne had a particular weight to it, a greasy insistence that soaked through wool and spirit alike. It was the same rain. It fell on the same sharp gables, turned the same cobbles of the Hohe Straße into the same treacherous, shining river. But the man who walked through it now was not the same man who had pushed a groaning cart.

Tilman did not pull his cloak tighter. He let the rain settle into the fibres, a cold baptism. He did not duck his head. He walked through the persistent mist as if it were a veil he had chosen to part. The judgement in the shadowed windows was no longer imagined; it was a palpable pressure, a focused attention that made the air hum. The *Eichhörnchen* were not in the shadows. They *were* the shadows, the silence between the drops, the unnatural stillness that held the city’s usual clamour at bay. He had felt their net close from twenty miles off, a gathering tension in the world’s noise. He had walked into it willingly.

He was not late. He was precisely, dreadfully on time.

The cathedral loomed ahead, its twin spires sheathed in the low cloud, a mountain range of ambition carved in stone. It was the root. All roads of seeking in this land led here, to this nexus of sanctioned wonder, this engine of divine authority. His feet, caked with the mud of fields and forest tracks, now trod the sacred flagstones of the approach. Pilgrims huddled under makeshift awnings, their eyes wide with a dutiful awe. Merchants called, their voices thin and metallic against the cathedral’s silent mass. It was the centre of the world he knew. And he had come to unmake its quiet centre.

He did not enter through the great west doors. That was for the faithful, for the spectacle. He slipped around the side, through the stonemasons’ yard where half-carved saints watched with blank eyes from their blocks of trachyte. A small, iron-bound door, used by the canons, stood slightly ajar. The pressure in the air was strongest here, a corked silence. He pushed it open.

The inside was not a space; it was a swallowing. The grey light from the high windows did not illuminate so much as it diluted the darkness, turning it into a vast, breathable substance. The pillars rose like a petrified forest, their branches lost in gloom. The air was cold, older than the cold outside, smelling of damp stone, incense, and the faint, iron tang of centuries of whispered prayer. The silence here was different. It was not the *Eichhörnchen*’s hunting silence. It was the silence of a held breath, of a colossal waiting. It was the silence God had left behind.

Tilman walked down the north aisle, his boots whispering on the stone. His heart was a calm, hard knot. The spiritual seeking that had once been a frantic scratching at doors, a desperate carving of questions into wood, had been refined in the furnace of his flight. It was no longer a question. It was a direction. A trajectory.

He reached the crossing, where the nave met the transept. Here, in the very heart of the vertical aspiration, was the horizontal fact of human labour: a scaffold. A lattice of oak poles and lashed planks climbed into the gloom, surrounding the base of the south tower where new stone was being laid. Tools lay on a tarpaulin—mallets, chisels, a mason’s drag. It was a place of becoming, of slow creation. It felt more sacred to him than any altar.

He climbed. The scaffold creaked, a familiar, organic sound in the mineral silence. He climbed past the reach of the diluted light, into the true dark of the vaults. The air grew colder, thinner. The sounds from below—a cough, a shuffled step—fell away, absorbed by the immensity. He stopped on a platform high above the floor, a tiny island in a sea of structured night. Here, he was a mote in the eye of the cathedral. He could see the logic of it, the terrifying geometry of faith made manifest. It was beautiful. It was a cage for the infinite.

From his pack, he did not take a carved box. He took the bust. He unwrapped it from its sacking. In the absolute dark, he did not need to see it. He felt it. The wood was warm, almost feverish, against his chilled hands. It was no longer just his father’s face. It was the face of every unanswered plea, every stifled cry, every human gaze turned upward in hope and met with this magnificent, echoing silence. It was the raw, beating heart he had laid on the market stones. It had been found. It had been brought here. The hunt had herded him to this precise point, believing they drove him to a corner. They did not understand they had delivered the weapon to its target.

He placed the bust on the planked floor of the scaffold, facing out into the nave.

Then he waited. He did not pray. He listened. He listened to the silence, parsing its layers. The architectural silence. The Godly silence. And beneath it, threading through it like a poison in a well, the *Eichhörnchen*’s silence—a predatory, absorbing void.

They came as the light shifted, a barely perceptible greying that signalled noon somewhere beyond the clouds. They did not climb. They appeared. One moment, the platform was his alone. The next, three figures stood on its other side, their forms indistinct in the gloom, as if they had coalesced from the shadows between the stones. They wore dark, simple clothes. They were utterly still. The pressure in the air became a physical weight, a denseness that made his ears pop.

“Tilman Roth,” one said. The voice was dry, papery, without origin. It seemed to come from the stone itself. “You have led a long chase. You have made… remarkable noise.”

Tilman said nothing. He looked at the bust between them.

“That object,” the voice continued. “It is an anomaly. A focal point for… unstructured seeking. It disrupts the acceptable order. It must be quieted.”

“Quiet it, then,” Tilman said, his own voice rough, human, a blasphemy in the stillness.

“It is not the object itself. It is the resonance. You have become part of its frequency. You must both be… absorbed. The story must end. The seeking must cease.”

Tilman finally looked at them. Their faces were bland, forgettable. But their eyes were not. They were the eyes of librarians of the soul, eyes that had seen every heresy, every ecstasy, and filed them away in a silent, airless archive. They were the final arbiters of the spiritual search, ensuring it never left the approved paths, never found anything that wasn’t already in the catalogue.

“Why?” he asked, the simplest of his questions. “Why silence it?”

“Chaos,” the central figure said, as if explaining rain to a child. “Unsanctioned seeking leads to unsanctioned finding. To personal revelation. To schism. To the breaking of vessels meant to contain the divine. We maintain the vessel. We preserve the silence in which the official word can be heard. Your noise is a crack in the bell. It must be mended.”

Tilman nodded. He understood. They were not evil. They were gardeners. They pruned the wild growth so the cultivated vine could thrive. They were the necessary silence at the heart of all organised wonder. His father’s lonely faith, his own desperate carving—they were weeds.

“And if the vessel is empty?” Tilman asked.

The silence that followed was different. It was shocked. It was the silence of a sacred text discovering a blasphemy written in its own margin.

“It is not empty,” the voice said, a hairline fracture in its dryness. “It is full of the prescribed mystery.”

“You preserve the silence so the echo sounds like a voice,” Tilman said. He was not arguing. He was stating a fact, the final finding of his search. “You hunt the real seekers because their hunger is a mirror. It shows the emptiness you spend your lives denying.”

He gestured to the bust. “That is not an anomaly. That is a witness. It is the sound of one man’s hunger. You can burn it. You can burn me. But you cannot burn the hunger. You can only ever herd it. To the edges. To the forests. To the tops of scaffolds in your own cathedrals. And one day, the hunger will be louder than your silence.”

The three figures moved. It was not a step. It was a convergence, a tightening of the air. The platform seemed to shrink. The pressure became a force, pushing in on him, not on his body, but on his *attention*, on the very core of his seeking self. It was an erasure. He felt memories soften at the edges—the smell of his father’s workshop, the feel of the chisel in his hand, the weight of the first box. They were being blotted out, absorbed into their vast, silent archive. To be forgotten by them was to be unmade.

He fought not by pushing back, but by doing the one thing they could not comprehend. He sought. Here, in the heart of their power, he turned his gaze not to them, but inward, to the cold, sharp resolution that had coiled in his gut since he left the bust in the square. He sought the shape of his own despair, the exact contour of his unanswered question. He gave it his full attention.

And he picked up the bust.

The moment his fingers closed on the warm wood, a sound began. Not a sound in the air. A sound in the *silence*. A low, resonant hum, like a struck bell heard through stone. It came from the bust. It vibrated up his arms, into his teeth. The *Eichhörnchen* froze. Their convergence stuttered. The hum grew, not in volume, but in depth, in complexity. It was the sound of a single, focused life. The joy, the sorrow, the doubt, the love, the petty angers and the sublime reaches—all the chaotic, unsanctioned noise of Bernhard Roth, distilled into a frequency of pure being.

It was unbearable. To them.

The central figure recoiled, a stiff, jerking motion. The bland face showed a crack of something like pain. “It… resonates. It is unrefined. Unfiltered. Stop it.”

Tilman held it out, not as a weapon, but as an offering. A truth. “This is what you silence. This is the chaos you fear. Not heresy. Not blasphemy. *This.*”

The hum was spreading. It was seeping into the stones of the scaffold, into the cold air. It was a tiny, defiant vibration in the cathedral’s monumental stillness. It was the crack in the bell.

“Take it,” Tilman said, his voice steady. “Absorb it. File it away in your silence. Let me see you try.”

The three figures moved together, a single, fluid motion of negation. They reached for the bust, not with hands, but with their focused, annihilating attention. The hum wavered. It began to thin, to be pulled apart, its frequency parsed and catalogued for erasure. Tilman felt it draining from the wood, felt his own memories blurring further. They were winning. They were the silence, and all sound died in them.

He had one move left. The final, vulnerable act.

He closed his eyes. And he sought, not for an answer from the void above, but for a specific memory within. He sought the memory of sound. Not the hum, but a human sound. His father’s voice. Not preaching. Not praying. Laughing. A rare, unguarded, belly-deep laugh at some foolish thing young Tilman had done. A sound of pure, unspiritual, un-sanctified joy. A noise that belonged to no cathedral, that served no doctrine. A weed of a sound.

He found it. A frayed thread in the tapestry they were unweaving. He held it. He gave it his full attention.

And the bust, in his hands, sang.

It was not a hum. It was a clear, bright, echoing peal of laughter. It rang out in the vast, silent vault. It bounced off the pillars, danced in the ribbed vaulting, shot up towards the unseen roof. It was absurd. It was profane. It was gloriously, triumphantly human.

The effect on the *Eichhörnchen* was catastrophic. They did not scream. They *unmade*. Their forms frayed at the edges, like ink in water. The pressure shattered. The absorbing silence ruptured. The central figure’s eyes, just before they dissolved into the general gloom, held not anger, but a profound, bewildered terror. They had encountered a force their entire existence was designed to negate: a purely personal, utterly meaningless, irreducibly human joy. It was a spiritual seeking that had found, not God, but itself. They had no file for it. It could not be archived. It could only be experienced, or destroyed.

They chose retreat. They were not destroyed; they were negated. Their presence evaporated, withdrawing from the epicentre of the unbearable noise, fleeing back into the sanctioned shadows from whence they came. The platform was just a platform again. The air was just cold, old air.

The sound of the laughter faded, its last echoes swallowed by the cathedral’s immense capacity for stillness. But the silence that returned was different. It was not the *Eichhörnchen*’s silence. It was the old silence. The empty silence. And in it, the memory of the laugh hung, a ghost of warmth.

Tilman looked down at the bust. The wood was cool now. Dormant. It was just a carving again, a skilled piece of memory. The resonance was spent. The weapon had discharged. He felt spent too, hollowed out. The coiled resolution in his gut was gone. In its place was a vast, quiet fatigue, and a clarity as sharp as the Cologne rain.

He rewrapped the bust and placed it back in his pack. He descended the scaffold, his limbs heavy. The cathedral floor felt more solid than ever. He walked back down the north aisle. Pilgrims were lighting candles now, tiny, hopeful points of light in the gloom. The merchants’ calls from outside were clearer. The world’s babble was seeping back in.

He pushed open the small iron-bound door and stepped out into the rain. It was the same rain. But he was not the same man.

He had sought sanctuary from the silence. He had found that the only sanctuary was in becoming the noise the silence could not contain. He had sought a divine answer. He had found a human sound. He had sought an end to his seeking. He had found that the seeking itself, in all its raw, chaotic, personal hunger, was the point. It was the crack that let the light in. It was the weed that broke the stone.

He did not walk towards the city gates. He turned and walked back into the heart of the Hohe Straße, into the greasy insistence of the rain and the clamour of men. He was not fleeing. He was returning. The hunt was over. The hounds of silence had been called off, not by a greater power, but by a smaller, truer one.

He would go back to his father’s workshop. He would open the shutters. He would take up a fresh block of limewood. He would not carve a box for a question. He would not carve a bust for a memory. He would carve something new. Something that held no question, sought no answer. Something that was just its own shape, its own reason. A shape that might, if held just right, catch the light in a way that reminded you of a laugh in a silent place.

The spiritual seeking was not over. It had simply changed its object. It now sought to make the inner resonance tangible. To give form to the noise. To build a sanctuary not from silence, but of sound.

He walked, a man who had stared into the organising void and made a rude noise. The rain soaked him through. It felt clean.
